    "abstract": "In this issue, Webster and colleagues report findings and provide direction following a systematic review and evidence synthesis designed to understand the decisional needs of research participants considering whether to receive biomarker or genetic risk information. The report serves as a foundation for a future of participant-centered approaches to the return of individual results in Alzheimer's disease research. This Ethics Response comments on the authors' terminology choices highlighting the notable absence of references to disclosure. The Response concludes that alternative terms like return or sharing of results offer less stigmatizing and more patient-centered approaches to communicating biomarker and genetic test results.",

    "title": "Mitochondrial DNA: a molecular switch driving sterile neuroinflammation.",
    "abstract": "Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) plays a pivotal role in the regulation of neuroinflammation, acting as a potent trigger of innate immune responses when released into the cytoplasm or extracellular space. mtDNA is structurally similar to bacterial DNA, containing unmethylated CpG motifs that are readily recognized by immune sensors. Under conditions of cellular stress, injury, or mitochondrial dysfunction, mtDNA can escape into the cytoplasm, where it activates the cGAS (cyclic GMP-AMP synthase)-STING (stimulator of interferon genes) signaling pathway, or it can be detected extracellularly by Toll-like receptors on immune cells. These signaling events lead to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and type I interferons, amplifying neuroinflammatory responses. In the central nervous system, this process contributes to the pathogenesis of various neurodegenerative and inflammatory conditions, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), etc.. The dual role of mtDNA as both a damage-associated molecular pattern and a signaling molecule underscores its importance as a therapeutic target for modulating neuroinflammation and protecting against progressive neuronal damage. In this review, we will discuss the implications of mtDNA-mediated neuroinflammation in neurodegenerative diseases, including AD, PD, and HD, highlighting its potential as a diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic target.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by beta-amyloid (Abeta) induced disruption of brain homeostasis, leading to neuronal damage and cognitive impairment. Increasing evidence confirms that microglia-driven neuroinflammation serves as a core mechanism driving the progression of AD. Mammalian Ste20-like kinase 1 (MST1) plays a crucial regulatory role in apoptosis, immune inflammation, and oxidative stress. Our team's previous research revealed that MST1 regulates mitochondrial oxidative stress in neurons, contributing to the pathogenesis of AD. Here, we show that MST1 is activated as p-MST1 in the peripheral blood of AD patients, the serum of 5xFAD mice, and the hippocampal and cortical brain tissues of 5xFAD mice, an effect which was associated with microglial pyroptosis under chronic inflammatory stimulation. Knocking down MST1 in hippocampal and cortical tissues of 5xFAD mice improved cognitive deficits, reduced p-tau protein levels, and alleviated neurodegeneration and neuroinflammatory responses. Concurrently, MST1 knockdown suppressed abnormal microglial activation, decreased inflammatory cytokine release, and ultimately mitigated microglial pyroptosis. Mechanistically, we found that MST1 knockdown modulated DPP8 protein expression, thereby regulating the NLRP1/Caspase-1/GSDMD-N signaling axis to inhibit microglial pyroptosis and attenuate neuroimmune inflammation. In summary, MST1 knockdown improved AD disease progression by preventing disruption to the immune-inflammatory homeostasis of microglia. Therefore, we propose targeting MST1 as a promising therapeutic strategy to halt neuroinflammation and progression in Alzheimer's disease.",

    "abstract": "Although the younger age of first exposure (AFE) to American football has not been associated with neurodegenerative pathology, AFE has been associated with clinical symptoms. However, the literature is mixed. We examined the association between AFE to football and clinical outcomes before and after age 60 at death, to isolate the potential role of decreased neuropathological resilience in older age. This study included 677 deceased male football players who donated their brains to the Understanding Neurologic Injury and Traumatic Encephalopathy Brain Bank. Informants completed modified scales assessing cognition, function, behavior, and neuropsychiatric features with dementia adjudicated through consensus conferences. Regressions tested the association between AFE and dementia, chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) pathology, and each scale, adjusted for multiple testing. Analyses were stratified by age 60, adjusting for age at death, duration of play, and neuropathology. Most donors (mean age = 60.9, standard deviation = 19.8) played college or professional football (n = 509, 76%). CTE was the most prevalent neuropathology (n = 471, 70%). AFE was not associated with neurodegenerative disease pathology. Among those older than 60 at death, younger AFE was associated with cognitive composite score impairment (odds ratio: 0.897, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.814-0.988, p = 0.027) and worse cognitive (beta: 0.04, 95% CI: 0.01-0.069, p = 0.009), neurobehavioral (beta: 0.032, 95% CI: 0.002-0.062, p = 0.035), and neuropsychiatric (beta: 0.032, 95% CI: 0.00-0.064, p = 0.048) composite scores. Younger AFE was only associated with worse informant-reported clinical outcomes in older deceased football players, independent of neurodegeneration. Our findings offer a potential explanation for the mixed literature on AFE and clinical outcomes. The effects of AFE may only manifest in older adults when cognitive reserve is depleted, neuropathological resilience is reduced, or age-related vulnerabilities interact with prior head injury exposure, worsening clinical outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is increasingly recognized as a disorder of dysregulated immunometabolism at the neurovascular-glia-neuron interface. Systemic metabolic stressors such as insulin resistance, dyslipidaemia, and obesity converge on brain innate immune cells to reprogram energy pathways and sustain maladaptive inflammation. In microglia, metabolic rewiring across glycolysis-oxidative phosphorylation balance, glutaminolysis, and lipid handling governs trained-immunity programs that dictate amyloid and tau clearance, synaptic maintenance, and neurotoxicity. These processes converge on druggable nodes including AMPK-mTOR signaling, HIF-1alpha, and tricarboxylic-acid intermediates. Neurovascular fuel delivery is likewise impaired: endothelial GLUT1 loss and mitochondrial stress at the blood-brain barrier accelerate amyloid accumulation and neuronal injury. Lipid metabolism bridges metabolism and inflammation, as APOE4-driven microglial lipid droplets link genetic risk to inflammatory phenotypes. NLRP3 integrates metabolic danger signals into chronic neuroinflammation. Translational momentum now builds around metabolic interventions particularly GLP-1 receptor agonists and SGLT2 inhibitors that modulate glial metabolism, systemic inflammation, and barrier integrity. Converging metabolomic, lipidomic, and extracellular-vesicle biomarkers enable tracking of these pathways in humans, defining an immunometabolic axis of AD and supporting precision-medicine strategies to reprogram metabolism for disease modification.",

    "abstract": "Dementia diagnosis increasingly relies on blood-based biomarkers, yet their performance in diverse populations remains insufficiently characterized. Latin America, with substantial genetic and environmental heterogeneity, is particularly underrepresented in biomarker research. Here we show that plasma AT(N) biomarkers can distinguish Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) in a multinational Latin American cohort (N = 605). Abeta(42)/Abeta(40) amyloid-beta ratios were reduced and levels of phosphorylated tau (p-tau217, p-tau181) and neurofilament light chain (NfL) were elevated in both disorders, with NfL showing greater increases in FTLD. Classification models achieved receiver operating characteristic areas under the curve (ROC AUCs) of 83% for AD and 88% for FTLD. Meta-analyses confirmed consistency across countries, and these markers correlated with executive, memory and global cognitive impairment. Biomarker alterations combined with disease-specific neuroimaging patterns and cognitive measures further improved accuracy (ROC AUCs of 89% for AD and 95% for FTLD). These findings indicate that plasma AT(N) biomarkers, combined with neuroimaging and clinical assessments, can enhance dementia diagnosis across diverse Latin American populations.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) poses major health, social and economic challenges to the modern world. Despite the advances in understanding AD, our knowledge about its pathogenesis remains incomplete. Recent data suggest that circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) undergo complex changes in AD. Since these changes are yet to be comprehensively characterized, we investigated miRNAs in the context of AD using two meta-analytical approaches. We reproducibly identified 2895 miRNAs in a cohort of 4186 individuals from 22 studies. Here we show that 194 miRNAs exhibited widespread changes in AD, including some novel miRNAs not yet linked to AD. These novel AD miRNAs broaden the landscape of research on the role of miRNAs in AD. Targets of these miRNAs further uncovered many biological pathways that, to date, remain poorly understood in AD with several \"AD miRNAs\" never described in the brain. \"AD miRNAs\" described outside the brain significantly influenced interleukin signaling, Toll receptor signaling, p38 MAPK pathway and insulin/IGF pathway. Our results reveal a greater complexity of biological pathways involved in AD than previously thought and raise the question of whether AD is indeed a brain-specific and not a systemic disorder. These findings advance current understanding of AD pathogenesis and lay the ground for the development of next-generation AD biomarkers and design of miRNA-engaged therapies.",

    "abstract": "The abnormal accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau in neurofibrillary tangles is a hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia. In AD, tangle pathology characteristically develops in brain regions with heightened vulnerability, such as the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus. Emerging evidence implicates mitochondrial dysfunction and metabolic disturbances in AD progression, yet the relationship between regional vulnerability and pretangle tau-driven transcriptomic changes remains unclear. Here, to address this critical gap, we utilized the tau P301S transgenic mouse model (PS19 line), which develops tau inclusions. Using spatial transcriptomic profiling across the hippocampal and cortical regions at selected disease stages, we captured spatiotemporal transcriptional responses to tauopathy. Our findings reveal that disease-associated microglia and astrocyte phenotypes emerge concurrently with phosphorylated tau accumulation across multiple brain regions. Intriguingly, the expression of Pgk1, a hub gene of the glycolytic pathway, was upregulated along with other metabolic pathway genes in the CA3 region at 2 months of age, preceding the onset of detectable tau tangle pathology, and correlated with tangle severity, suggesting early metabolic dysregulation in vulnerable regions. Further analysis of differentially expressed genes uncovered region-specific and temporally dynamic transcriptional patterns in the cortex and hippocampus. Early saturable alterations in ATP metabolic processes, glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation appeared in the hippocampus at 2 months of age, with delayed engagement in the cortical regions. These results underscore the contributions of metabolic stress and glial activation to tauopathy and regional vulnerability, highlighting spatial transcriptomics as a powerful tool for uncovering region-specific molecular insights into disease mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by synaptic dysfunction and proteostatic imbalance, partly driven by amyloid-beta oligomers (Abetao). This study focuses on the effects of low-concentration Abetao exposure on synaptic architecture and de novo protein synthesis in primary cortical neurons, and assesses the neuroprotective potential of the MAP kinase interacting kinase (MNK) inhibitor, eFT508. Using expansion microscopy, we observed that 5-day exposure of low concentrations of Abetao significantly increased synapse density, particularly single synaptic boutons (SSBs) and multi-innervated spines (MIS). This finding indicates that we modelled increases in synapses characteristic of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a transition to AD. The clinically approved MNK inhibitor eFT508 partially suppressed these synaptic alterations, restoring synapse density to control levels. While total de novo protein synthesis remained unchanged under Abetao exposure using bioorthogonal non-canonical amino acid tagging (BONCAT), subsequent proteomic profiling identified selective changes in de novo protein synthesis that are involved in synaptic function, cytoskeletal regulation, mitochondrial activity, autophagy, and the ubiquitin-proteasome system, and part of these dysregulations could be inhibited by eFT508. These findings indicate that Abetao exposure in an in vitro model of AD leads to synaptogenesis and dysregulation in de novo protein synthesis and they identify eFT508 as a compound that can counteract some of these Abetao-induced dysfunctions.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies have revealed many alternative exons differentially spliced across diverse neuron types in the mammalian brain, but their links to neuronal physiology remain unclear. Here we characterize a deeply conserved microexon E35a in Ank3 encoding ankyrin-G (AnkG), a multifaceted adaptor protein best known as a master organizer of the axon initial segment (AIS) and as a leading genetic risk factor for bipolar disorder. E35a is predominantly skipped in cortical glutamatergic neurons but included in cortical GABAergic neurons and cerebellar neurons, which is dictated by multiple neuronal splicing factors. In E35a-deletion mice we generated, interneurons show increased excitability and somatic Ca(2+) activity, without disruption in AIS. Biochemical analyses suggest that E35a inclusion facilitates AnkG interaction with a protein complex involving inositol trisphosphate receptors (InsP3Rs) important for intracellular Ca(2+) signaling. Alternative splicing therefore allows AnkG to modulate neuron type-specific excitability in addition to its ubiquitous pan-neuronal role in organizing the AIS.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Previous studies of community-dwelling people with Alzheimer's disease (AD) have reported an association between the severe neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) of dementia and caregiver burden. We explored the current status of family caregiver burden, NPS of dementia, and care service usage in Japanese community-dwelling people with AD. METHODS: A web-based questionnaire was administered to cohabitant family caregivers of community-dwelling people with AD from 13 to 27 November 2023. Amongst 8108 participants registered in the panel data, 705 family caregivers (age: 19-79 years) were selected. Participants completed the Japanese version of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Brief Questionnaire. RESULTS: Family caregivers (n = 705) had a mean +/- standard deviation (SD) age of 54.6 +/- 11.5 years, 56.9% were male, and 84.0% cared for a parent or in-law with AD. Patients with AD had a mean +/- SD age of 84.2 +/- 8.8 years; 26.2% were male, and 90.6% had NPS, including 73.4% with hyperactivity (agitation, disinhibition, irritability and aberrant motor behaviour). Mean +/- SD caregiving time per week was higher for caregivers of patients with NPS versus without NPS (24.1 +/- 22.1 vs. 17.6 +/- 14.0 h). The dissatisfaction with nursing care support services was higher amongst caregivers of patients with NPS vs. without NPS. To manage hyperactivity, 11.3% of caregivers administered medication and 11.5% relocated patients to a calm environment; 16.6% of the caregivers had no way to cope. Amongst caregivers who responded 'administer medication' in response to hyperactivity, 32.1% had care staff or a medical provider come in and administer oral medication and 18.9% took the patient to a medical facility to receive an injection or intravenous treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Caregiving for AD patients with NPS (vs. without NPS) was associated with longer duration of caregiving, greater usage of nursing care services and dissatisfaction with nursing care support services.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: We developed a novel silk fibroin@polydopamine (SF@PDA) material and investigated the mechanism of SF@PDA acupoint implantation for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in a mouse model. METHODS: In the materials research phase, we characterized the surface morphology and properties of the novel SF@PDA composites and evaluated their safety using the cell counting kit-8 assay. Following the intervention, C57BL/6 mice underwent open-field experiments and the Morris water maze test. We analyzed the collected tissues with hematoxylin-eosin staining, immunofluorescent staining, Western blotting, reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: After acupoint implantation, SF@PDA reduced amyloid-beta (Abeta) deposition and preserve neurons, thereby improving cognitive performance. In particular, SF@PDA can reduce the expression of inflammatory factors, including interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and inhibit the inflammatory response, thereby further reducing Abeta accumulation and neuronal damage. The SF@PDA treatment resulted in an increase in exploratory behavior and a decrease in the number of errors in mice. Meanwhile, the number of Abeta plaques in the brain was significantly reduced (P < 0.05), and inflammatory cell infiltration was lessened. CONCLUSION: SF@PDA acupoint implantation has significant therapeutic effects on AD model mice. The mechanism can be related to the inhibition of inflammatory response, reduction of Abeta deposition, and promotion of nerve regeneration.

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD), a leading global cause of dementia, disability, and mortality, represents a critical unmet need for effective therapeutic interventions. Drug repurposing offers an expedited pathway to address this challenge compared to traditional drug development. Here, we leveraged network-based prediction and real-world patient data validation, a comprehensive strategy to identify unanticipated therapeutic applications for existing medications. Traumatic brain injury (TBI), a major risk factor for earlier and more severe AD, exhibits heterogenous clinical outcomes influenced by genetic susceptibility, suggesting that TBI-diagnosed populations represent a cohort enriched for neurodegeneration vulnerability. Building on this premise, we integrated network-based multi-omics and endophenotypic disease modules from individuals with TBI and AD histories with large real-world patient data analysis from insurance claims to prioritize repurposable drugs. A network proximity algorithm applied to TBI- and AD-associated gene sets identified statistically ranked candidates, including doxycycline and irbesartan. We then assessed all candidates' AD risk reduction potential using a nationwide Medicare database encompassing nearly 9 million individuals. In a retrospective observational study of AD-free elderly individuals monitored for up to 3 years, propensity-score adjusted survival analyses demonstrated a significantly reduced cumulative incidence of AD in doxycycline and irbesartan-prescribed individuals, with risk ratios of 0.92 and 0.83, respectively, at a 95 % confidence interval. These findings nominate doxycycline and irbesartan as potential repurposable drugs for AD and demonstrate the translational potential of synergizing network-based prediction with real-world patient evidence in drug repurposing for neurodegenerative disease if broadly applied.",

    "abstract": "Objective: To investigate the effects and mechanisms of enriched environment(EE) on cognitive function in Alzheimer's disease (AD) model mice. Methods: Sixteen male 6-month-old APP/PS1 mice of SPF grade were randomly divided into standard environment group (AD group), and enriched environment group (ADEE group), with 8 mice in each group. Additionally, 16 C57BL/6J mice with matched body weight were selected as the control group and randomly divided into an enriched environment group (NCEE group) and a control group (NC group), with 8 mice in each group. The mice were adapted to the environment for 2 weeks, followed by 12 weeks of intervention. The Morris water maze test was used to assess learning, memory, and exploration abilities; Immunofluorescence staining and Western blot (WB) were performed to detect the levels of Abeta, Tau protein, silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1alpha (PGC-1alpha). Results: The Morris water maze test showed that the AD group had fewer platform crossings, fewer effective area crossings, shorter effective area dwell time, fewer target quadrant entries, and shorter target quadrant dwell time compared to the NC group (all P<0.05). In contrast, the ADEE group exhibited more effective area crossings, longer effective area dwell time, more target quadrant entries, and longer target quadrant dwell time compared to the AD group (all P<0.05). Immunofluorescence staining results revealed more Abetaplaques and Tau protein positive cells in the AD group and ADEE group compared to the NC group and NCEE group (all P<0.01). After EE intervention, the ADEE group exhibited lower Abeta plaques and Tau protein positive cells than the AD group (all P<0.05). Immunofluorescence staining and WB both demonstrated that SIRT1 and PGC-1alpha expression in AD mice was lower than in NCEE and NC mice (all P<0.05). Following EE intervention, both the ADEE and NCEE groups showed higher SIRT1 and PGC-1alpha levels compared to the AD group and NC group (all P<0.05). Conclusion: EE may improve the pathological progression and cognitive impairment of AD by activating the SIRT1/PGC-1alpha signaling pathway.",

    "title": "Relationships between alcohol use and dementia: protocol for an observational study in the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink.",
    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Alcohol consumption is an increasingly recognised modifiable risk factor for dementia, yet whether it has differential impacts on dementia subtypes and its role in disease progression remains unclear. This study aims to: (1) quantify the association between alcohol intake and incidence of dementia subtypes and (2) examine whether individuals who drink heavily and develop dementia referred to hereafter as 'alcohol-related'-have poorer post-diagnosis outcomes compared with other dementia cases. Clarifying these relationships will determine whether alcohol selectively increases risk for specific dementia phenotypes or broadly heightens neurodegenerative vulnerability, with implications for prevention, clinical counselling and therapeutic targeting. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This population-based cohort study of alcohol and dementia will use linked UK electronic health records from Clinical Practice Research Datalink, Hospital Episode Statistics and Office for National Statistics (ONS). Participants will be eligible if they have available linked data from January 1998, when ONS death registrations became available, until the end of follow-up. Alcohol exposure will be defined through self-reported recorded weekly alcohol units and diagnostic codes for harmful or dependent alcohol use. Primary outcomes including incident all-cause and subtype-specific dementia (eg, Alzheimer's, vascular, Lewy body, Parkinson's, frontotemporal) as well as secondary outcomes (ie, mortality, care-home entry and neuropsychiatric symptoms). Key covariates encompassing socio-demographic factors, smoking and relevant comorbidities will be adjusted for. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards and Fine-Gray competing risk models will estimate associations with dementia incidence. Post-diagnosis prognosis will be compared for dementia in individuals with a history of heavy alcohol use ('alcohol-related') and dementia in individuals with minimal alcohol exposure ('non-alcohol-related') cases using survival and logistic regression models. Multiple testing correction will be applied across dementia subtype comparisons. Alcohol exposure will be modelled continuously and non-linearly using restricted cubic splines and categorically using binary indicators of harmful/dependent use. Missing covariate data will be assessed and addressed using appropriate methods, including multiple imputation and complete-case analysis. Data extraction and analysis are scheduled from October 2025 to October 2026. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Use of de-identified routine data will proceed under existing Research Ethics Committee and data governance approvals. Findings will be disseminated via open-access peer-reviewed journals, academic conferences and summaries targeted at patient, public and policy audiences. The results of this study will be reported according to the STROBE (Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology) and The REporting of studies Conducted using Observational Routinely-collected health Data (RECORD) guidelines.",

    "abstract": "The neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is due to amyloid-beta(1-42) (Abeta(1-42)) triggered cytokines release from the brain resident immune cells. Interleukin-17 A (IL-17 A) is one of the crucial cytokines involved in orchestrating neuroinflammation and exacerbating AD pathology. Thus, IL-17 A may be considered as one of the key therapeutic options to control AD progression. This study was conducted using BALB/c mice divided into four groups, such as control group, Abeta(1-42) (5 mug) group, Abeta(1-42) (5 mug) + IL-17 A neutralizing antibody (1 mug) group, and Abeta(1-42) (5 mug) + antibody control (IgG1 isotype, 1 mug) group. The intranasal exposure of either Ass(1-42) or vehicle was administered once daily for the first seven consecutive days. The intranasal exposure to anti-mouse IL-17 A neutralizing antibody or isotype control was performed once daily from day 5 to day 7, one hour after Ass(1-42) exposure. The memory evaluations were conducted through the Morris water maze, novel object recognition test, and passive avoidance test. The brain IL-17 A cytokine levels were increased >2-fold in Abeta(1-42)-exposed mice as compared to control. IL-17 A antibody exposure led to significant partial improvement in cognitive memory and significantly reduced the expression of AD biomarkers (amyloid precursor protein, beta secretase, phosphorylated tau) along with a significant suppression of IL-17 A signaling axis, astrogliosis, neuronal damage and cytokines in the brain regions of Abeta(1-42)-exposed animals. In conclusion, neutralizing IL-17 A prevented Abeta(1-42)-mediated effects and revealed IL-17 A as a potential therapeutic target involved in the regulation of AD progression and pathology.",

    "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Danggui Shaoyao San (DSS), a classic TCM formula traditionally for gynecological diseases, shows promising efficacy in Alzheimer's disease (AD) per recent studies. It regulates metabolic disorders, which is a key feature of AD and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), yet the mechanism of its \"homotherapy for heteropathy\" across these diseases remains unclear. AIM OF THE STUDY: This study aimed to verify the therapeutic effects of DSS on both AD and PCOS, and explore its underlying mechanisms involving metabolic regulation, gut microbiota modulation, and the MAPK signaling pathway. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Materials and methods: AD models were established by Abeta(25-35) hippocampal injection, and PCOS models by testosterone propionate combined with high-fat diet. These models were validated via behavior tests and histopathology. Network pharmacology was used to predict DSS targets. Western blot and qPCR were employed to detect the activation status of the MAPK pathway. Metabolic assays and 16S rRNA sequencing were applied to analyze metabolic indexes and gut microbiota structure. RESULTS: DSS inhibited overactivation of the MAPK pathway in both models, which is consistent with network pharmacology predictions. It restored lipid/steroid hormone homeostasis and increased the abundance of beneficial Lactobacillus in gut microbiota, while alleviating AD and PCOS pathological phenotypes. CONCLUSION: DSS exerts \"homotherapy for heteropathy\" effects on AD and PCOS by synergistically regulating the MAPK pathway, metabolic balance, and gut microbiota, providing experimental evidence for its clinical application in these metabolically linked diseases.",

    "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Defined by the selective loss of central nervous system neurons, a progressive neurodegenerative disorder is what Alzheimer's disease (AD) constitutes. It is recognized as the leading cause of dementia globally. Polygonatum sibiricum, also known as \"tiger ginger\" and \"chicken-head ginseng\" , was hailed as a \"treasure herb\" by the ancient Chinese pharmacologist Li Shizhen. As a traditional Chinese medicine, its primary active component, Polygonatum sibiricum polysaccharide (PSP), has demonstrated well-defined neuroprotective effects. AIM OF THE STUDY: The core objective of the present research was to dissect the molecular mechanisms that underlie the therapeutic actions of PSP in AD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: PSP was purified through water extraction, alcohol precipitation, decolorization, Sevag method deproteinization, and dialysis. The purified polysaccharide was characterized by ultraviolet and infrared spectroscopy. Spatial learning was evaluated as examined by performance in the Morris water maze. To investigate the pathological processes involved in PSP's effects, a range of techniques were employed, including Nissl staining, biochemical assays, immunohistochemistry, transmission electron microscopy, immunofluorescence, and western blotting. The interaction between PSP and the DLAT protein was examined using the CETSA. RESULTS: Experimental findings indicated that administration of PSP mitigated cognitive impairments in mice with AD and attenuated the loss of neuronal cells. Furthermore, PSP ameliorated mitochondrial damage, modulated cuproptosis-related proteins, and activated the phosphorylation of PI3K and AKT. CONCLUSION: The present study demonstrates that PSP improves cognitive impairments in 3xTg-AD mice by targeting DLAT and subsequently activating the PI3K/AKT pathway. The findings from in vitro cellular models align with those observed in in vivo studies. Consequently, PSP emerges as a promising agent endowed with therapeutic potential for AD treatment.",

    "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: \"Turbidity toxin damages brain\" has been identified as a critical etiopathogenetic mechanism in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Haikun Shenxi Capsule (HKSX), a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formula with efficacy in dissolving turbidity and eliminating toxicant, is clinically used for chronic renal failure (CRF). AIM OF THE STUDY: Based on the TCM theory of \"treating different diseases with the same therapy\", this study aimed to investigated the neuroprotective effects and molecular mechanisms of HKSX on AD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: SAMP8 mice and N2aApp695 cells were used as AD models, behavioral, pathological assessments, as well as metabolomics, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), immunofluorescence (IF), immunohistochemistry (IHC) and western blot analyses, were conducted to validate HKSX's therapeutic effects and underlying mechanisms on AD. RESULTS: Behavioral testing results showed that HKSX significantly improved learning and memory impairments of SAMP8 mice in novel object recognition (NOR) test and Morris Water Maze (MWM) test, along with reduced levels of Abeta and p-Tau at Thr231 in hippocampus. In metabolomics profiling, HKSX was demonstrated to modulate 73 metabolites and key metabolic pathways, including unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis, tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and D-glutamine/D-glutamate metabolism, which are closely related with mitochondria. TEM showed that HKSX improved mitochondrial swelling and cristae rupture in SAMP8 mice, accompanied by increased autolysosomes. HKSX also enhanced mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels, reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) content, suggesting that it significantly improved mitochondrial structure and function. IHC showed that HKSX administration significantly increased PINK1-positive staining. IF double-labeling results indicated that HKSX promoted the co-localization of Parkin-Tom20, LC-3-LAMP, and mitochondria-lysosomes, providing direct evidence of mitophagy activation. However, inhibition of mitophagy with Mdivi-1 abrogated HKSX-induced activation of PINK1-Parkin signaling, blocked clearance of turbidity toxins, such as Abeta, p-Tau and ROS, and suppressed autophagosome formation in N2a/APP695 cells, confirming that HKSX-mediated neuroprotection is mitophagy-dependent. CONCLUSIONS: This study established that HKSX alleviated AD-like pathological features and cognitive deficits by activating PINK1-mediated mitophagy pathway. These results suggest that mitophagy may be involved in the cellular process of \"eliminating turbidity toxins and detoxification,\" which provide a novel therapeutic angle for exploring TCM remedies that resolve turbidity in the treatment of AD.",

    "abstract": "Rosmarinic acid (RA), a naturally occurring ester of caffeic acid and 3,4-dihydroxyphenyllactic acid, is widely distributed in medicinal plants of the Lamiaceae families. It has attracted considerable attention due to its broad spectrum of pharmacological properties, including strong antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antiviral, neuroprotective, and anticancer activities. Nevertheless, the therapeutic application of RA has been hampered by poor cell membrane penetration ability, and limited oral bioavailability. To address these challenges, extensive efforts have been devoted to the chemical modification of RA, leading to a wide range of semi-synthetic and fully synthetic derivatives. This review systematically summarizes and evaluates the bioactivity of current RA derivatives. We highlight how different structural modifications, such as esterification, amidation, dimerization, ring expansion, alkyl chain elongation, and metal coordination, can enhance pharmacological potency or improve pharmacokinetic behavior. A comparative \"Relative Activity\" assessment is also introduced to unify cross-study evaluations by directly comparing the activity of derivatives with the parent compound. Moreover, we discuss structure-activity relationships and underlying mechanisms, with emphasis on the therapeutic relevance of RA derivatives in oxidative stress, inflammation, cancer progression, viral infection, and metabolic disorders. Finally, we outline future perspectives on the rational development of RA-based drug candidates and their potential application in multifunctional theranostic systems.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressively neurodegenerative disorder. The accumulation and pathological aggregation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides are key events in the occurrence and progression of AD, positioning Abeta-targeted immunotherapy as a precision therapeutic approach. We present a click chemistry-assisted modular nanoparticle vaccine, Fe-Spy-3CAbeta, constructed via SpyCatcher-SpyTag-mediated site-specific conjugation of Abeta1-6 epitopes onto engineered ferritin nanocages. This self-assembling nanoparticle vaccine elicited enhanced immunogenicity in APPswe/PSEN1dE9 transgenic mice, generating high-titer antibodies that specifically recognize neurotoxic Abeta42 oligomers. The vaccine promotes robust clearance of Abeta plaques in the cortical and hippocampal regions while rescuing spatial memory deficits. Notably, sex-specific differences are observed in pathological clearance and behavioral improvements, with male mice exhibiting better cognitive performance and reduced neuroinflammation compared to female counterparts, highlighting sex-specific differences in AD progression. Further immunization of rhesus monkeys confirmed the potent immunogenicity and favorable safety of Ferritin-based Abeta vaccine. Critically, serum antibodies from vaccinated monkeys specifically bound Abeta plaques in AD model mouse brain tissues.Our modular nanoassembly platform overcomes key limitations of conventional AD vaccines regarding immune activation efficiency and safety profiles, while offering a versatile approach for developing immunotherapies for neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive cognitive decline, in which mitochondrial dysfunction plays a critical role. The mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) is a key regulator of mitochondrial calcium (mCa(2+)) uptake, and its dysregulation contributes to calcium imbalance and mitochondrial impairment. In this study, we investigated the effects of MCU knockdown in hippocampal neurons on synaptic plasticity and neuropathology in APP/PS1/tau mice. It was found that MCU knockdown reduced mCa(2+) overload, restored mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), and attenuated excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in the hippocampus. These mitochondrial improvements were associated with a rescue of impaired synaptic plasticity, including enhanced long-term potentiation (LTP) and reduced long-term depression (LTD) through activating the CaMKII/CREB/BDNF/TrkB signaling pathway. Furthermore, MCU knockdown alleviated hippocampal amyloid beta (Abeta) pathology by decreasing APP/BACE1/RAGE levels while increasing NEP/LRP1 levels, and mitigated tau pathology through downregulation of GSK3beta/CDK5 expression. In addition, hippocampal neuronal number and activity were improved, as reflected by increased N-acetylaspartic acid (NAA)/creatine (Cr) and glutamic acid (Glu)/Cr. Collectively, these findings indicated that MCU knockdown in hippocampal neurons ameliorated mitochondrial dysfunction, synaptic deficits, and AD-related pathology, highlighting MCU as a potential therapeutic target for AD.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a multifaceted neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive cognitive decline. According to the amyloid cascade hypothesis, amyloid-beta (Abeta) accumulation plays a central role in initiating and driving AD progression. However, therapeutic strategies targeting Abeta have yielded limited and inconsistent clinical benefits, highlighting the need for broader, multi-targeted approaches. Growing evidence identifies neuroinflammation as a central, disease-modifying mechanism in AD pathogenesis, supported by elevated inflammatory markers and immune-related genetic risk variants in patients. Multiple factors converge to sustain maladaptive neuroinflammation, including aging, genetic susceptibility, obesity, and the gut microbiota. Obesity, marked by white adipose tissue expansion and chronic low-grade systemic inflammation, promotes blood-brain barrier dysfunction and primes microglia toward pro-inflammatory phenotypes. In parallel, gut microbiota dysbiosis alters microbial metabolite production, increasing gut permeability, systemic endotoxemia, and neuroinflammatory signaling. Obesity is also associated with alterations in gut microbiota composition and metabolite profiles. Together, these metabolic and microbial cues mechanistically link peripheral dysfunction to central immune activation, accelerate amyloid and tau pathology, and are further amplified by genetic susceptibility and aging. This review synthesizes evidence connecting neuroinflammation with amyloid and tau pathology, emphasizing how obesity and gut microbiota dysbiosis amplify neuroinflammation and AD progression. We further evaluate two anti-inflammatory therapeutic strategies: omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, which modulate immune signaling and gut microbiota composition, and neural stem cell-based interventions, which suppress neuroinflammation through paracrine immunomodulation and microglial reprogramming. By defining key drivers of pathological neuroinflammation and strategies to modulate them, this work provides a framework for developing innovative, multi-targeted interventions that can be applied alone or in combination with classical anti-amyloid therapies.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder with a complex pathogenesis. Currently, there are still no drugs on the market that have a significant therapeutic effect. Zinc, an essential trace element, played a double-edged role in neuronal function-zinc deficiency accelerated cognitive decline and neurodegeneration, however overloaded zinc may cause beta-amyloid (Abeta) aggregation. In contrast, the brains of AD patients exhibited significantly elevated copper concentrations around Abeta plaques, where this localized high copper concentration microenvironment catalyzed oxidative reactions and Abeta aggregation, thereby exacerbating neuronal damage. To address the interconnected pathological targets, a novel carbamate porphyrin derivative (1) and its zinc complex (1-Zn) were designed and synthesized. Single crystals of both compounds were successfully obtained and analyzed. And with further Hirshfeld surface analysis, molecular dynamics predictions and frontier molecular orbital studies, their structure characteristics and intermolecular interactions were systematically analyzed. Subsequently, metal chelation assays, antioxidant activity evaluations, Abeta aggregation inhibition assays, and anticholinesterase assays were performed to assess the multi-target therapeutic potential. Notably, 1-Zn exhibited a dual-function metal dyshomeostasis regulation ability, namely, chelating excess Cu(2+) and at the same time releasing a specific amount of Zn(2+) to the system. In addition, 1 and 1-Zn showed comparable ROS scavenging ability (in vitro and in vivo) and Abeta aggregation inhibition ability to the positive control drugs. 1-Zn also showed similar cholinesterase inhibition activity as rivastigmine. Consequently, this study demonstrated that 1 and 1-Zn held potential as multifunctional anti-AD agents, meriting further investigation for clinical translation.",

    "abstract": "Recent evidence has highlighted the role of the oral microbiome in the inflammatory response and pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The oral pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis) and its gingipain virulence factors may be involved in the development of AD. Concurrently, a decline in the antimicrobial protein lactoferrin has been observed in AD saliva. In this study, we analyzed whether the presence of P. gingivalis and gingipain were associated with salivary lactoferrin and inflammatory markers in patients with AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and age-matched controls. Salivary presence of P. gingivalis was higher in MCI and AD patients and exhibited a negative correlation with global cognitive function. We further showed a marked reduction in salivary lactoferrin with AD progression. Salivary/plasma levels of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines were significantly higher and lower, respectively, in MCI and AD patients compared to controls. Specifically, salivary levels of Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-23 were higher in MCI and AD patients compared to controls, while the IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) and IP-10 were reduced in both saliva and plasma in AD patients. Moreover, stromal cell derived factor 1alpha (SDF1alpha)/CXCL12, macrophage inflammatory protein-1beta (MIP-1beta), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) salivary and plasma levels were reduced in AD patients. Correlation analyses revealed an inverse relationship between salivary lactoferrin and bacterial load and cytokine concentrations. Our findings suggest that AD is associated with alterations to the oral environment, as revealed by higher P. gingivalis presence, lower lactoferrin levels and elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines.",

    "abstract": "The gut-brain axis has emerged as a key pathway in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders, with age-related shifts in gut microbiota potentially contributing to cognitive decline and dementia progression. This systematic review evaluated the effects of microbiota-targeted interventions on cognitive outcomes in adults aged >45 years with cognitive impairment or at risk of dementia. Randomized controlled trials and quasi-experimental studies published up to June 2025 were identified through PubMed, COCHRANE, CINAHL, Web of Science, and EMBASE. Methodological quality, assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Checklist, ranged from moderate to high.Fifteen studies involving 4,275 participants across Europe, Asia, North America, and the Middle East met inclusion criteria. Interventions included probiotic supplementation, fecal microbiota transplantation, and dietary strategies such as Mediterranean and ketogenic diets. Cognitive outcomes were measured using validated tools, including the Mini-Mental State Examination, Montreal Cognitive Assessment, and Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status. Narrative synthesis indicated that microbiota modulation was associated with improvements in memory, executive function, and global cognition, particularly in individuals with prodromal or mild cognitive impairment. Reported benefits correlated with increased microbial diversity, enhanced short-chain fatty acid production, and reduced neuroinflammatory markers. In contrast, effects were limited in advanced Alzheimer's disease.Overall, gut microbiota modulation represents a promising nonpharmacological strategy to support cognitive health, with early intervention appearing crucial for optimal benefit. Nevertheless, heterogeneity in study design and intervention protocols highlights the need for large-scale, longitudinal randomized controlled trials to confirm efficacy and clarify underlying biological mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Dementia is a neurodegenerative disease in which environmental and lifestyle factors, including dietary habits, appear to play an important etiologic role. In particular, the effects of tea and coffee consumption are still under debate, having shown both protective and risk effects. This review aimed to assess the dose-response relation between coffee and tea consumption and risk of dementia. METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search to identify relevant studies using the electronic databases PubMed and EMBASE until December 9, 2025. Inclusion criteria were: population free of chronic diseases and without previous diagnosis of dementia, assessment of tea or coffee intake and of the risk of developing dementia, and cohort or cohort-nested case-control design. We assessed the quality of the studies with the ROBINS-E tool. We performed nonlinear dose-response modeling of dementia for increasing tea and coffee consumption. RESULTS: Ten studies were included in the analysis, with more than 450,000 participants at baseline and mean follow-up duration of 11.5 years. We found a progressive and linear decrease in all-cause dementia risk with increasing tea consumption, with comparable results for all tea types and for green tea only. Coffee demonstrated a U-shaped relation with the lowest risk between 2-3 cups/day (about 300/450 mL/day). The relation with Alzheimer's dementia showed no difference in risk until 3 cups of coffee per day when risk started to increase. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that moderate coffee consumption does not seem to affect dementia risk, while high coffee consumption (>/=3 cups/day) could increase risk of all-cause dementia and Alzheimer's dementia. Conversely, tea consumption appears to linearly decrease all-cause dementia risk, while for Alzheimer's dementia there seems to be no further decrease in risk with consumption above one cup/day.",

    "title": "From biosensing to herbal discovery: A nanozyme cascade platform for acetylcholinesterase monitoring and inhibitor screening in synthetic and natural sources.",
    "abstract": "Early diagnosis and therapeutic intervention for Alzheimer's disease (AD) necessitate advanced tools for detecting acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity and screening AChE inhibitors (AChEIs). This study developed a novel bimetallic MOF nanozyme, Cu-NH(2)-88B(Fe), exhibiting significant peroxidase-like activity. This nanozyme was integrated with AChE to construct a dual-enzyme cascade biosensing platform, which achieved highly sensitive AChE detection, with a detection limit of 0.01 mU/mL, and demonstrated excellent accuracy in fetal bovine serum (spiked recoveries: 92.07-111.09%). Additionally, the platform also enabled quantitative assessment of synthetic AChEIs, determining IC(50) values for donepezil (9.85 nM), neostigmine (1.41 muM), huperzine A (6.21 muM), and galantamine (611.31 muM), all of which exhibited broad linear ranges and high sensitivity. All four compounds exhibited a broad linear range and excellent sensitivity. Innovatively, the platform was applied to screen AChE inhibitory activity in seven traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs). Crucially, when comparing four extraction methods, ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE) proved most effective in liberating active compounds. The UAE-obtained extract of Poria cocos (Yunnan) showed the strongest inhibition, achieving an AChE inhibition rate of 39.03% at 0.01 mg/mL. Notably, the screening results across different species, origins, and extraction methods (including the superior UAE) showed high consistency with the classical Ellman method, validating the platform's reliability. This study not only provides a low-cost, easy-to-operate, sensitive, and reliable analytical strategy for AChE activity detection and AChE inhibitor development, but more importantly, it successfully applies nanozyme technology to the complex system of TCMs, offering strong technical support for the screening and preliminary identification of potential anti-AD active components from TCM resources.",

    "title": "Association between allostatic load and incident dementia, and race/ethnic disparities in the association in the U.S. health and retirement study.",
    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Allostatic load (AL), the cumulative physiological burden of chronic stress, is a significant health issue and has been linked with adverse health outcomes, including cognitive decline. We examined the association between AL and incident dementia in the United States. METHOD: We used data from the United States Health and Retirement Study (HRS) cohort (2016-2020) and the 2016 Venous Blood Study (VBS) to examine the association between AL quartile and incident dementia among participants who were aged 56 and older at baseline. Dementia status was determined by cognitive performance of immediate and delayed word recall, serial 7's, backward count, as well as self-report of dementia and Alzheimer's disease. A composite score of biomarkers from neuroendocrine, immune, metabolic, and cardiovascular systems was used to create AL quartiles. The Cox regression model was used to examine the association between AL quartile and incident dementia. RESULTS: Of the 6806 non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, and Hispanic participants, 331 (4.9 %) developed dementia by the end of 5 years, with an incident rate of 12.8 per 1000 person-years. In the age and sex adjusted model, incident dementia was higher in the highest AL quartile than the lowest AL quartile (HR = 1.96, 95 % CI [1.37, 2.80], p < .001). The association was attenuated (HR = 1.59, 95 % CI [1.08, 1.10], p < .05) after adjusting for sociodemographic and health behaviors. Race/ethnicity did not modify the association between AL and incident dementia despite higher incident dementia among minorities. DISCUSSION: The findings highlight the relationship between AL and incident dementia. Further studies of the context of social determinants of health with longer follow-up are needed. Findings may inform the need for interventions to reduce stress stimuli and regular monitoring of biomarkers, thereby delaying the onset of dementia.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a currently incurable neurodegenerative disease, with early detection representing a high research priority. AD is characterized by progressive cognitive decline accompanied by alterations in brain functional connectivity. Based on its data structure similar to the graph, graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as important methods for brain function analysis and disease prediction in recent years. However, most GNN methods are limited by information loss caused by traditional functional connectivity calculation as well as common noise issues in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. This paper proposes a graph generation based AD classification model using resting state fMRI to address this issue. The connectome generation network with large kernels for GNN (CGLK-GNN) based AD Analysis contains a graph generation block and a GNN prediction block. The graph generation block employs decoupled convolutional networks with large kernels to extract comprehensive temporal features while preserving sequential dependencies, contrasting with previous generative GNN approaches. This module constructs the connectome graph by encoding both edge-wise correlations and node-embedded temporal features, thereby utilizing the generated graph more effectively. The subsequent GNN prediction block adopts an efficient architecture to learn these enhanced representations and perform final AD stage classification. Through independent cohort validations, CGLK-GNN outperforms state-of-the-art GNN and rsfMRI-based AD classifiers in differentiating AD status. Furthermore, CGLK-GNN demonstrates high clinical value by learning clinically relevant connectome node and connectivity features from two independent datasets.",

    "title": "[Prevalence of Dementia and Cognitive Decline in Portuguese Residential Care Homes: A Cross-Sectional Study].",
    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Dementia is one of the leading causes of dependency among older people and poses a critical challenge for long-term care systems. Despite the importance of the issue, national data on the prevalence of dementia in residential care homes remain limited. METHODS: A cross-sectional, observational, and institution-based study was conducted within the framework of the SINDIA project. The study was based on an online survey addressed to the technical directors of residential care homes for older people in Portugal, carried out between January and July 2024. The questionnaire collected information on institutional characteristics (sector, territorial location, base monthly fee, dementia specialization, and total number of residents) and on the prevalence of formally diagnosed dementia cases and of cognitive decline without a recorded diagnosis. Data were analyzed using the R software (version 4.1.2). Mean percentages and 95% confidence intervals (Student's t-method), weighted by NUTS-2 region, were calculated. A hierarchical cluster analysis (Ward's method) was also performed to identify distinct institutional profiles. RESULTS: On average, 31.7% of residents had a formal dementia diagnosis and 22.3% showed signs of undiagnosed cognitive decline, resulting in 50.2% of the resident population presenting some degree of cognitive impairment, after data cleaning. The proportion varied across territories, institutional sectors, monthly fees and self-reported specialization. A cluster analysis identified three distinct institutional profiles, with a majority group of facilities characterized by lower diagnostic formalization, especially in the non-profit sector and among lower-cost institutions. CONCLUSION: The findings are suggestive of a very high prevalence of cognitive impairment in Portuguese residential care homes. These results highlight the need for public policies aimed at improving early diagnosis, enhancing staff training, and reducing territorial and institutional inequalities in the response to dementia.",

    "title": "Mapping the Landscape, Knowledge Gaps, and Areas for Innovation in Brain Health and Dementia Research in Canada: Protocol for a Scoping Review of Reviews.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Dementia is one of Canada's most pressing public health challenges, with rates expected to surge in response to the country's aging population. Given the rapidly growing issue of dementia, understanding national research efforts is critical to prioritizing and advancing strategic directions in brain health and dementia research. Recently, the Canadian Institutes of Health Research awarded a 1-year funding grant from the Brain Health and Cognitive Impairment in Aging Research Initiative to map the scope of brain health and dementia research in Canada. OBJECTIVE: This scoping review of reviews protocol aims to address this call by outlining the methodology that will be used for mapping the research landscape, documenting the knowledge gaps, and identifying areas of innovation to advance brain health and dementia research in Canada. METHODS: Given the large volume of literature, a scoping review of Canadian-led reviews was selected as the most appropriate method because it would allow for a robust synthesis of nationally relevant research while mapping knowledge gaps and innovation. Our scoping review of reviews will follow the framework by Arksey and O'Malley along with the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) guidelines. The search will focus on peer-reviewed literature reviews published between January 1, 2020, and January 1, 2025, to capture the current state of knowledge since the national dementia strategy's publication in 2019. This search will be conducted using 5 electronic databases: CINAHL, PubMed, PsycInfo, Scopus, and Web of Science. Our data extraction table will include the following categories: author, province, and year; aim; review timeline; method; theme; knowledge gaps; innovations; and findings. The data will be analyzed using a combination of deductive and inductive thematic analysis. RESULTS: This protocol was registered on June 5, 2025, with the Open Science Framework. This study was funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research from November 2024 to November 2025. The anticipated timeline for the publication of the full scoping review of reviews is May 2026. The findings from this review will be shared through targeted knowledge mobilization activities such as presentations at national funding agency meetings, academic conferences, and community workshops. CONCLUSIONS: Our scoping review of reviews will provide a robust synthesis of the brain health and dementia research landscape, helping document critical knowledge gaps and identify areas for innovation. The results of this research will provide critical data to help inform strategic funding initiatives and future research directions. The findings from our scoping review will have implications for research funders, policymakers, community organizations, and researchers that are working to accelerate brain health and dementia research across Canada.",

    "abstract": "Hippocampal theta and gamma oscillations degenerate early in Alzheimer's disease (AD), and may be a critical pathogenic factor and therapeutic target for AD. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) improves abnormal theta and gamma oscillations in AD; however, how these oscillations dynamically change after stimulation remains unclear. Exploring the prolonged neuroregulatory effects of DBS is essential for optimizing parameters and treatment strategies. Therefore, we investigated the sustained changes in the theta and gamma oscillations of the hippocampal cornu ammonis 1 region induced by acute DBS of the entorhinal cortex in APP/PS1 model mice and explored the underlying mechanisms. The results showed that the theta (4-8 Hz), low gamma (30-50 Hz) and high gamma (50-100 Hz) power of DBS-treated APP/PS1 mice exhibited a dynamic increase-decrease-increase trend, and the modulation index of theta and high gamma increased significantly and persisted for three weeks after DBS. Compared with the pre-DBS state, the firing rates of interneurons in APP/PS1 mice decreased significantly, while those of pyramidal neurons increased significantly, and the mean vector lengths of pyramidal neurons and interneurons with theta and gamma oscillations decreased significantly. Furthermore, the expression of CaMKII-alpha and GAD67 increased significantly. These findings suggest that acute DBS targeting the entorhinal cortex induces compensatory changes in the power of theta and gamma oscillations in APP/PS1 mice potentially by regulating the neuronal excitatory/inhibitory balance, thereby improving neuronal information transmission.",

    "title": "Web of Potentials: Neuroactive Components of Spider Venom and Their Emerging Pharmacologic Applications in Neurologic Diseases.",
    "abstract": "Spider venom has emerged as a promising source of neuroactive compounds with potential applications in the treatment of complex neurological disorders. With over 53,000 described species and more yet to be studied, spiders possess one of the most chemically diverse venoms in the animal kingdom. This diversity has evolved through ecological adaptation, enabling spiders to paralyze and manipulate the nervous systems of a wide range of prey. These same mechanisms, which target ion channels, neurotransmitter receptors, and signaling enzymes, coincide with pathways implicated in human neurologic diseases. By examining the structure-function relationships of spider venom components, this review highlights how venom compounds can modulate neuronal excitability, synaptic transmission, inflammation, and neurodegeneration. Evidence of therapeutic relevance is found in diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, stroke, erectile dysfunction, and anxiety, where specific spider-derived components have demonstrated potential disease-modifying effects. Furthermore, by integrating molecular action with disease relevance and ecological context, this review proposes a shift in how spider venom is viewed-not simply as a source of isolated toxins, but as a platform for next-generation therapeutics. This integration of ecological, molecular, and therapeutic dimensions not only synthesizes current knowledge but also charts a path for future interdisciplinary research by revealing critical translational gaps and offering strategies to bridge them toward effective neurotherapeutics.",

    "title": "Capturing silent oxidative stress in early Alzheimer's disease: prediction of CSF biomarkers from sleep qEEG data.",
    "abstract": "Oxidative stress is a central pathogenic process in the earliest stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD), promoting non-enzymatic protein modifications that accumulate in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) before measurable neurodegeneration. These alterations impair proteostasis and disrupt sleep-regulating neural circuits, producing characteristic changes in sleep electroencephalographic patterns. Because CSF sampling is invasive, quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG) has emerged as a promising non-invasive proxy for early oxidative processes. Here, we investigated whether nonlinear and time-domain sleep qEEG features can estimate CSF oxidative stress biomarkers in early AD using machine learning (ML) models. Forty-two mild-to-moderate AD patients underwent overnight polysomnography, from which sleep qEEG features were extracted. CSF protein oxidation biomarkers-glutamic semialdehyde, aminoadipic semialdehyde, N-carboxyethyl-lysine, N-carboxymethyl-lysine, and N-malondialdehyde-lysine-were quantified by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, and ML models were trained to predict CSF biomarker levels from qEEG features. The best-performing model was a random forest trained on the first principal component, achieving an R2 of 0.625 and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 467.1 pg/mL. Features derived from frontal and central electrodes during slow-wave sleep and rapid eye movement sleep contributed most strongly to predictive performance. Predictions for healthy controls displayed distributions distinct from those of AD patients, supporting the biological specificity of the qEEG-based estimates. These exploratory analyses suggest that sleep qEEG combined with ML can noninvasively capture silent oxidative processes involved early in AD pathological cascades, with potential for risk stratification, disease monitoring, and non-invasive upstream biomarkers development.",

    "title": "Ultrasensitive Saliva-Based Detection of Early Alzheimer's Disease Biomarkers via Nanoparticle-Enhanced Evanescent Scattering Microscopy.",
    "abstract": "Non-invasive biomarkers for early Alzheimer's disease (AD) screening remain a critical unmet need. Current cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) assays, while highly informative, are invasive and unsuitable for large-scale or repeat testing, whereas blood-based biomarkers, despite recent diagnostic advances, still face challenges related to assay standardization, analytical complexity, and sophisticated instrumentation requirements. Saliva represents an attractive alternative matrix due to its accessibility and minimal burden on patients; however, the extremely low abundance and instability of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides have thus far limited the development of reliable salivary diagnostics. We developed and validated a nanoparticle-enhanced total internal reflection scattering (TIRS) microscopy platform for ultrasensitive, real-time quantification of salivary Abeta proteins. Metallic nanoparticles functionalized with anti-Abeta antibodies were used to amplify scattering signals and enable robust detection at sub-picogram concentrations. The assay was evaluated in two established AD mouse models, APP(sl) and 5xFAD, in comparison with wild-type controls (n = 33 and n = 34, respectively). Since the validation of Abeta levels in saliva is not feasible with current state-of-the-art technologies, we validated the findings by measuring Abeta levels in the cortex and hippocampus via immunohistochemistry and ELISA. The TIRS assay demonstrated high analytical sensitivity and specificity for Abeta detection in saliva. In both APP(sl) and 5xFAD models, salivary Abeta(4)(2) concentrations were significantly elevated in transgenic mice and showed strong correlations with brain amyloid deposition. Logistic regression and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers were applied to quantify diagnostic performance and threshold-based discrimination based on salivary Abeta(4)(2), identified as the most discriminative Abeta form in descriptive analyses. In APP(sl) mice, logistic regression and SVM models achieved 92% classification accuracy with balanced sensitivity and specificity. These findings establish nanoparticle-enhanced TIRS as a rapid, accurate, and non-invasive tool for salivary Abeta quantification. By overcoming historical limitations of saliva-based biomarker detection, this technology provides a foundation for future translational development, including validation in human cohorts and optimization toward scalable and point-of-care diagnostic implementations.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that leads to gradual deterioration of cognitive functions. Cholinesterase enzymes play a critical role in regulating acetylcholine levels in the brain, and their dysfunction leads to impaired cholinergic neurotransmission, which is a primary hallmark of AD and contributes significantly to the cognitive decline and dementia. Here, a series of pyrazine-1,2,3-triazole molecular hybrids incorporating a trifluoromethyl (-CF(3)) group were synthesized (8a-o). Synthesized compounds were then evaluated in vitro for cytotoxicity and cholinesterase inhibitory activities. All synthesized compounds were found to be nontoxic toward BV-2 cells in the cytotoxicity screening. The in vitro inhibition assays revealed that these derivatives exhibited greater inhibitory potency against acetylcholinesterase (AChE) than butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE). Among them, compound 8h demonstrated the most potent AChE inhibition compared to BuChE (AChE, IC(50) = 5.43 microM; BuChE, IC(50) = 127.12 microM). The most active compound 8h was further subjected to molecular docking and dynamic simulation (100 ns) to investigate its binding affinity, thermodynamic behavior, and stability within the active site of cholinesterase enzymes. Overall, the findings suggested that the synthesized compounds represent promising drug candidates as selective acetylcholinesterase inhibitors for the treatment of AD.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD), marked by the misfolding/aggregation of beta-amyloid (Abeta), is a major global health challenge. Polyoxometalates (POMs), as anionic therapeutic agents, exhibit potential in depolymerizing Abeta fibrils, inhibiting Abeta fibrillation, and acting as a photocatalyst. To achieve targeted reactive oxygen species (ROS) amplification, we developed a chitosan-modified near-infrared (NIR)-responsive upconversion nanoplatform, UCNPs(Tm/Er)@SiO(2)@GPS@CH, as a targeted carrier for POMs. The nanoplatform was constructed by sequentially modifying upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) with a silica layer, 3-glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane (GPS, as a linker), and chitosan (CH, a cationic biomacromolecule). The cationic CH layer enabled efficient loading of anionic POMs through electrostatic interactions with an optimal POM loading capacity of 415.41 mug mg(-1) that positively correlated with CH modification levels. Under NIR irradiation, the nanoplatform triggered a photodynamic effect with abundant ROS. Notably, compared with the control group and Abeta monomer group, the ROS generation in the Abeta fibril group was approximately doubled, which further enhanced the targeted therapeutic efficacy of the system. By integrating NIR responsiveness, cationic chitosan, targeted ROS generation, and low systemic toxicity, the nanoplatform provides a novel strategy for the photooxidative treatment of AD and offers insights into the design of chitosan-modified upconversion nanoparticle-based drug carrier systems.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurological disorder marked by amyloid-beta aggregation, tau abnormalities, impaired neuronal signaling, and related toxicities. Abeta aggregation, while a key factor, is one of several contributors, and its role as a therapeutic target continues to be explored. Efforts to target Abeta aggregation-prone regions with structure-based inhibitors face challenges like poor bioavailability, off-target effects, and limited clinical efficacy. Strategies such as small molecules, peptide therapeutics, and immunotherapies have been explored to inhibit fibrillization, while metal chelators, beta-sheet breakers, and molecular chaperones help modulate aggregation and maintain protein homeostasis. Given Alzheimer's multifaceted nature, tau-directed therapies, anti-inflammatory agents, and synaptic modulators are also under investigation. Drug delivery to the brain is constrained by the blood-brain barrier, yet advances in medicinal chemistry, molecular modeling, and rational design of drugs and delivery systems are improving therapeutic strategies.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The sortilin-related receptor (SORL1) directs APP and Abeta trafficking within the retromer pathway. Cleavage at the cell surface releases soluble SORL1 (sSORL1) into cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). We examined whether CSF-sSORL1 can serve as an in vivo marker of genetically impaired SORL1. METHODS: CSF-sSORL1 was quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in 218 participants: 90 carriers of SORL1 variants, 78 SORL1-wildtype (WT) AD patients, and 50 SORL1-WT controls. RESULTS: sSORL1 concentrations were significantly lower in carriers of protein-truncating and damaging missense variants. In SORL1-WT patients, CSF-sSORL1 correlated with pTau181 but not with Abeta42 among AD patients, and did not differ between patients and controls. DISCUSSION: These findings suggest that impaired SORL1 trafficking reduces receptor delivery to the cell surface and thereby decreases sSORL1 shedding, supporting its potential use as a pathway-specific biomarker. HIGHLIGHTS: Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) enables quantitative measurement of soluble sortilin-related receptor (sSORL1) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). sSORL1 levels are reduced in CSF from carriers of a pathogenic SORL1 variant. CSF-sSORL1 levels correlate with tau pathology in Alzheimer's disease. sSORL1 levels represent an in vivo biomarker of SORL1 function.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Sensitive memory paradigms may allow the detection of subtle memory changes associated with early Alzheimer's pathology in individuals without established clinical symptomatology. METHODS: We explored the cross-sectional association between performance on Tablet-based Cognitive Assessment Tool (TabCAT) Favorites, a brief computerized memory test, with cerebrospinal fluid AT status (A for amyloid-beta and T for phosphorylated tau) and its discriminative validity in 727 clinically asymptomatic participants from the European Prevention of Alzheimer's Disease (EPAD) Longitudinal Cohort Study. Episodic memory was also evaluated with the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status Delayed Memory Index (RBANS-MI). RESULTS: Compared to A-T- individuals, poorer TabCAT Favorites Total Correct (Favorites-TC) cross-sectional performance was associated with an increased likelihood of A+T+ status, but not A+T- status. There were no significant associations between AT status and RBANS-MI. Among individuals with low Favorites-TC performance, AT status predicted progression on the Clinical Dementia Rating > 0. DISCUSSION: Favorites-TC is a sensitive measure for the early detection of cognitive changes in the early stages of the AD continuum. HIGHLIGHTS: We explored Tablet-based Cognitive Assessment Tool (TabCAT) Favorites scores and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) AT status (A for amyloid-beta and T for phosphorylated tau) in asymptomatic individuals. Poorer Favorites performance linked to higher A+T+ likelihood. TabCAT Favorites is a sensitive tool for detecting early cognitive changes in Alzheimer's disease (AD).",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The locus coeruleus (LC) degenerates early in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the extent of rostrocaudal degeneration across clinicopathologic heterogeneity remains underexplored in AD. METHODS: Using digital pathology, we quantified LC neuronal density and area at three neuroanatomic levels in a large AD series. RESULTS: Analysis of neuropathologic AD subtypes revealed greater middle LC vulnerability in hippocampal sparing AD compared to typical and limbic predominant AD. Regression analyses identified distinct predictor variables associated with the degeneration of rostral and middle LC. Age at onset predicted 24% of the variability in rostral LC neuronal density, whereas Braak stage, brain weight, Lewy body disease, and age at onset accounted for 15% of the variability in middle LC. Analyses of clinical presentations revealed lower rostral LC neuronal density in non-amnestic compared to amnestic AD cases. DISCUSSION: These insights demonstrate greater LC degeneration in atypical clinicopathologic forms of AD, including hippocampal sparing, young-onset, and non-amnestic presentations.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Tauopathies are a heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative disorders defined by abnormal aggregation of tau protein. Although cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has uncovered disease-specific tau structures, translating these insights into diagnostic tools remains difficult. METHODS: We developed a heparin-free, salt-modulated real-time quaking-induced conversion (RT-QuIC) assay using K12 and K11 tau substrates, targeting aggregation-prone regions. This current method improves on previous methodology by minimising the number of required substrates by modulating reaction salt content in order to differentiate yet-undistinguished tauopathy strains. Thioflavin T fluorescence kinetics and attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy were used to classify tau aggregates from human brain homogenates. RESULTS: This method differentiated eight tauopathies, including Alzheimer's disease, Pick disease, progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), corticobasal degeneration (CBD), argyrophilic grain disease (AGD), frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism associated with chromosome 17 with N279K mutation (FTDP-17 N279K), and globular glial tauopathies types II and III. Subclassification of 4R tauopathies was achieved by modulating salt conditions and analyzing aggregation profiles. FTIR confirmed preservation of conformational differences. DISCUSSION: This salt-modulated, heparin-free RT-QuIC platform enables sensitive tauopathy classification based on strain-specific kinetics and structure. It offers a practical tool for diagnostic development, mechanistic studies, and therapeutic screening.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAlzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder with progression leading to a decline in cognition. Despite the extensive research, conventional therapies have limited activity and often cause side effects. This demands the need for novel, safer, and effective treatment of AD.ObjectiveThe objective of this study was to determine the phytochemical constituents and determine the anti-Alzheimer's activity of Persicaria hydropiper.MethodsThe total phenol and flavonoid content of the Persicaria (MP) methanol extract was determined, and active principles were identified using GC-MS. The neuroprotective activity was investigated using biochemical assays against Abeta(1-42)-induced neurodegeneration in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell lines.ResultsPhytochemical analysis revealed the presence of phenols (258.33 mg GAE) and flavonoids (48.31 mg QE). GC-MS identified the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant bioactive compounds. MP exhibited strong ABTS and DPPH radical-scavenging activities and inhibited AChE and BACE1 enzymes. In SHSY5Y cells, MP prevented Abeta(1-42) aggregation, restored cell morphology, reduced reactive oxygen species levels, and preserved mitochondrial membrane potential. It suppressed Abeta and tau fibrillation, downregulated Bax and Caspase, upregulated Bcl2, Beclin-1, LC3B-II, and LAMP1, and reduced IL-6, TNF-alpha, and GSK3beta expression, indicating potent neuroprotective, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory effects.ConclusionsOverall, the results imply that Persicaria hydropiper exhibits protective activity on neuroblastoma cell lines by mitigating oxidative stress, Abeta/tau fibrils, cell death, and inflammation while also inducing autophagy induced by Abeta(1-42). Further in vivo studies are needed to validate the findings to establish the plant as a potential source of anti-Alzheimer's drug.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Epigenomic dysregulation contributes to Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related tauopathies. Acetyl-CoA synthetase 2 (ACSS2), a nuclear-localized metabolic enzyme in neurons, supports histone acetylation and learning-related gene expression. We examined how ACSS2 loss affects molecular and behavioral phenotypes in a mouse model of tauopathy. METHODS: We induced tauopathy in ACSS2 knockout and control mice via injection of pathological human tau. We assessed transcriptomic, epigenomic, and behavioral changes, and tested long-term acetate supplementation as a rescue strategy. RESULTS: ACSS2 loss worsened tau-seeding-related phenotypes, particularly in hippocampal pyramidal neurons and Cajal-Retzius cells. Acetate supplementation rescued learning in an ACSS2-dependent manner and restored gene expression linked to cognition. DISCUSSION: ACSS2 acts as a neuroprotective metabolic enzyme in vulnerable hippocampal neurons, and targeting this pathway through dietary supplementation may offer therapeutic potential for AD and related tauopathies. HIGHLIGHTS: We combine tau seeding with deletion of acetyl-CoA synthetase 2 (ACSS2) to test this enzyme in an Alzheimer's disease model. Loss of ACSS2 exacerbates transcriptional and behavioral responses to tau injection. We observe robust transcriptional dysregulation in pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus. We observe reduced numbers of reelin-producing Cajal-Retzius cells in the hippocampus. Acetate supplementation rescues transcriptional and behavioral responses to tau.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Impaired autophagy has been implicated in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and Parkinson's Disease (PD). Consistent and replicated evidence indicate that Glucagon-like Peptide-1 Receptor Agonists (GLP-1RAs) exert treatment and preventative effects across disparate neurologic and mental disorders, potentially through mechanisms involving autophagy. This systematic review examined the effects of GLP-1RAs on autophagy in cell and animal models of AD and PD, as a proof of concept, to determine if these agents can be repurposed for the prevention and treatment of neurodegenerative and other mental disorders. METHODS: A systematic search on PubMed, Web of Science, and OVID (Medline, Embase, and APA PsycInfo databases) was conducted from inception to June 17, 2025. Screening was performed independently by two reviewers (MCS and IH) using predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Subsequently, a quality assessment was conducted. RESULTS: The search yielded 142 studies, of which 14 were included. Across studies, GLP-1RAs (e.g., liraglutide, semaglutide, and exendin-4) autophagy-specific markers, including beclin-1, LC3-II/LC3-I, ATG7, ATG3, and LAMP1, while normalizing p62 levels. DISCUSSION: In addition to promoting neurogenesis, neuroplasticity, and reducing inflammation, GLP-1RAs appear to modulate molecular and cellular systems contributing to autophagy, potentially mediating their broad therapeutic effects. Collectively, these studies present promising findings of GLP-1RAs for neurodegenerative and mental disorders; however, further studies are required to establish their translatability to human populations.",

    "abstract": "Fyn is a Src-family tyrosine kinase implicated in synaptic dysfunction and neuroinflammation across multiple neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). Saracatinib (AZD0530) is a potent Src-family inhibitor that has been explored as a repurposed therapeutic; however, its clinical utility is limited by poor kinase selectivity caused by high sequence conservation within Src-family ATP-binding sites. Here, we combine surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and X-ray crystallography to define saracatinib recognition by the Fyn kinase domain (KD). SPR single-cycle kinetics shows that saracatinib binds the isolated Fyn KD and full-length Fyn with low-nanomolar affinity, whereas dasatinib binds with subnanomolar affinity and markedly slower dissociation. We determined the crystal structure of the Fyn KD-saracatinib complex at 2.22 A resolution. The kinase adopts an active-like conformation with the DFG motif and alphaC-helix in the 'in' state and a conserved beta3 alphaC Lys-Glu salt bridge. Saracatinib occupies the adenine and ribose pockets, and engages the hinge through direct and water-mediated hydrogen bonding while complementing a hydrophobic back pocket by van der Waals contacts. Comparison with reported saracatinib-bound structures of other kinases suggests that the active-state geometry observed for Fyn creates a pocket not observed in inactive-like complexes, providing a structural handle for designing Fyn-selective inhibitors. Comparison with all saracatinib-bound kinase co-structures currently available in the PDB (ALK2 and PKMYT1) indicates a conserved monodentate hinge binding mode but kinase-dependent alphaC-helix conformations, providing a structural rationale for designing Fyn-selective analogues.",

    "title": "Montelukast suppresses NLRP3 inflammasome activation as a potential prophylactic agent against gout arthritis flares.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Gout arthritis (GA) flares are unexpected bouts of heat, swelling, and redness resulting in excruciating pain caused by monosodium urate (MSU) crystal deposition in the synovial joints. GA flare symptoms occur as a by-product of the inflammatory response as immune cells engulf MSU crystals in the joint. The NLRP3 inflammasome is the major source of the inflammatory response to MSU crystals; therefore, we hypothesize that prophylactic administration of agents that target the NLRP3 inflammasome could be used to suppress GA flares. RESULTS: We previously performed a screen of 875 FDA-approved drugs to identify candidates that suppressed NLRP3 inflammasome activation without causing cytotoxicity in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM). In this study, one of the candidates, montelukast, an anti-asthma drug, significantly suppressed Nlrp3- and Caspase-1-dependent IL-1beta and IL-18 secretion by BMDM. Furthermore, in an MSU-induced mouse model of GA flares, treatment with montelukast mitigated pro-inflammatory cytokine/chemokine secretion, including inflammasome-dependent cytokines (IL-1beta and IL-18), and edema. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, these data suggest montelukast is a robust suppressor of the NLRP3 inflammasome that could be repurposed as a prophylactic agent to mitigate GA flares.",

    "title": "Postoperative Cognitive Dysfunction and Neurodegeneration: From Inflammation to Precision Medicine.",
    "abstract": "Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is a prevalent neurocognitive complication in elderly surgical patients, marked by memory, attention, and executive function impairments. Its pathophysiology involves neuroinflammation, blood-brain barrier disruption, mitochondrial dysfunction, and Alzheimer's disease (AD)-like pathologies, including amyloid-beta accumulation and tau hyperphosphorylation. Although often reversible, persistent POCD may accelerate neurodegeneration in high-risk individuals, underscoring the need for early biomarkers and targeted therapies. This review synthesizes current evidence on POCD mechanisms, risk factors, and management. Key findings highlight the role of neuroinflammatory mediators (e.g., cytokines, microglial activation) and shared pathways with AD, such as synaptic dysfunction and neurotrophic deficits. Major risk factors include advanced age, genetic susceptibility (e.g., ApoE4), and pre-existing cognitive decline. Emerging interventions-anti-inflammatory agents (minocycline, dexmedetomidine), neuroprotectants (melatonin, IGF-1), and non-pharmacological strategies (BIS-guided anesthesia, exercise)-show promise. Precision medicine approaches, including tailored anesthesia and repurposed AD therapeutics, could further improve outcomes. In conclusion, POCD lies at the intersection of acute perioperative stress and chronic neurodegeneration. Future research should prioritize biomarker validation, individualized prevention, and long-term cognitive monitoring to address the growing burden of POCD in aging populations.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) requires the discovery of new therapeutic targets, but traditional molecular docking methods for virtual screening are often computationally expensive. This study introduces PhysDual-GCN, a physics-informed graph neural network designed to approximate docking-derived binding affinity scores for DYRK2, an understudied yet biologically relevant target in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The model jointly processes ligand molecular graphs and a sequence-based graph representation of DYRK2, while explicitly incorporating Coulomb and Lennard-Jones interaction terms as analytical physical energy components. Because no experimentally measured binding affinities are available for DYRK2-drug pairs, all reference labels used for evaluation were obtained exclusively from widely used classical docking tools (AutoDock Vina, Smina, QVina, CB-DOCK). These tools exhibit an inherent uncertainty of approximately +/- 0.5-1.5 kcal/mol, which constrains the interpretability of absolute deviations. PhysDual-GCN was trained solely on docking-derived scores and evaluated using a strict ligand-level separation to avoid circularity during model development. Due to the limited number of ligands (n = 4 FDA-approved AD drugs: brexpiprazole, donepezil, galantamine, rivastigmine), the results should be viewed as agreement with computational references rather than generalizable predictive performance. The model achieved low absolute errors (MAE = 0.31 kcal/mol; RMSE = 0.44 kcal/mol) relative to the reference docking scores and correctly identified stronger binders such as donepezil (- 10.8 kcal/mol) and brexpiprazole (- 10.0 kcal/mol). These findings demonstrate that integrating physical interaction terms into a GNN framework can enhance interpretability while providing a computationally efficient surrogate for classical docking workflows. Overall, PhysDual-GCN offers a biologically meaningful and explainable approximation tool for DYRK2 interaction scoring. While the present results are constrained by the small number of compounds and the absence of 3D protein features, the approach establishes a foundation for future large-scale, experimentally validated studies in AD drug repurposing.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive decline accompanied by chronic neuroinflammation. Emerging evidence implicates T-cell infiltration and microglial activation as key immune events that accelerate AD pathology, yet therapeutic approaches targeting this neuroimmune interface remain scarce. Cobrotoxin (CTX), a short-chain neurotoxin derived from Naja atra venom, exhibits potent anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties and is clinically approved in China for the treatment of chronic pain syndromes. Here, we investigated whether CTX could alleviate neuroinflammation and cognitive deficits in 5 x FAD mice, a transgenic model of AD. Intranasal CTX administration for nine weeks enhanced spatial learning and memory in the Morris water maze without altering amyloid-beta burden. Flow cytometry and immunofluorescence revealed that CTX markedly reduced brain-infiltrating CD8(+) T cells and downregulated chemokines implicated in T cell-microglia communication, including Cxcl9, Cxcl10, Cxcl16, and Ccl5. Consistent with this, CTX attenuated microglial activation and pro-inflammatory cytokine release while preserving plaque-associated microglia (disease-associated microglia, DAM). Morphological and electrophysiological analyses demonstrated that CTX restored dendritic complexity, spine density, and hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP), indicating improved synaptic integrity. Collectively, these findings identify CTX as a potent modulator of neuroimmune signaling that mitigates neuroinflammation and synaptic dysfunction in AD, suggesting its potential for repurposing as an immunomodulatory therapy for neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) represents a continuously advancing neurodegenerative condition distinguished by the unremitting deterioration of cognitive abilities and memory impairment, which significantly hampers daily functioning of life. In the absence of disease modifying treatments, it continues to pose a significant global challenge. Though symptomatic treatment exists, the inherent complexity involved with AD pathogenesis related to Abeta plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, etc. poses a tremendous challenge to developing drugs. With the incidence of AD increasing yearly globally, research into already existing pharmacological agents has the potential to uncover a brighter future for breakthroughs in treatment strategy. A primary strategy to accelerate the development of AD therapies is drug repurposing: determining a new use for an existing known medication. Following innovative approaches like high-throughput screening, AI-based techniques, a number of classes of drugs originally designed for other diseases are now being tested to modulate the complex pathology mechanisms in AD. This review focuses on the therapeutic promise of drug repurposing as adjunctive to the much-needed renaissance in AD therapies. The review continues to focus on some promising repurposed drug candidates, methodologies applied, and the evaluation of the present status of drugs in the clinic. Apart from the information regarding mechanisms involved in AD, this review also complements case studies, challenges, and limitations along with the various drug repurposing strategies for AD. By understanding and harnessing the potential of existing pharmacological agents, we can expand therapeutic options and improve patient outcomes.",

    "abstract": "This study investigates the therapeutic effectiveness of intranasal dantrolene nanoparticle pretreatment to inhibit lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced pathological inflammation, synapse destruction, and depressive and anxiety behavior in mice. B6SJLF1/J adult mice were pretreated with intranasal dantrolene nanoparticles (dantrolene: 5 mg/kg), daily, Monday to Friday, 5 days per week, for 4 weeks. Afterwards, mice were treated with a single intraperitoneal injection of LPS (5 mg/kg). Behavioral tests for depression and anxiety were performed 24 h after the one-time LPS injection. Biomarkers for pyroptosis-related inflammation cytokine levels (IL-1beta and IL-18) in the blood and brain were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunoblotting, respectively. Changes in primary protein (NLRP3: NLR family pyrin domain containing 3, Caspase-1, N-GSDMD: N-terminal protein gasdermin D) and synapse protein-related (PSD-95 and synaptin-1) activation of inflammatory pyroptosis in mouse brains were measured using immunoblotting. Results indicated that intranasal dantrolene nanoparticle treatment robustly inhibited LPS-induced increases in depressive and anxiety behavior, LPS-induced pathological elevation of IL-1beta and IL-18 levels in the blood and brain, and LPS-induced activation of pyroptosis. Furthermore, intranasal dantrolene nanoparticles significantly inhibited decreased PSD-95 and synaptin-1 levels. Intranasal dantrolene nanoparticles have demonstrated neuroprotective effects against inflammation-mediated depression and anxiety behaviors and should be studied further as a future effective drug treatment of major depressive or anxiety disorders.",

    "abstract": "Preeclampsia (PE), a major hypertensive disorder of pregnancy, is increasingly recognized as a significant risk factor for cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Placental ischemia in PE leads to an anti-angiogenic state, characterized by elevated soluble FMS-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt-1) and reduced placental growth factor (PlGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), causing systemic endothelial dysfunction. These alterations may persist during the postpartum period, promoting cerebrovascular impairment, blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption, and neuroinflammation. Furthermore, PE is associated with the release of AD-related proteins, including amyloid-beta (Abeta) and hyperphosphorylated tau protein. However, the potential link between AD and PE regarding the angiogenic and anti-angiogenic factors is not fully elucidated. This review aims to explore the shared pathophysiological pathways, focusing on the angiogenic and anti-angiogenic factors.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) involves beta-amyloid (Abeta) accumulation, tau pathology, and neuroinflammation, driving cognitive decline. Despite extensive research, disease-modifying therapies remain elusive. We integrated single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), spatial transcriptomics, and in vitro validation to identify repurposable drugs for AD(1). METHODS: Computational drug repurposing was performed using cell-type-specific analysis of scRNA-seq datasets from AD cortical regions. Trichostatin-A (TSA) effects were validated in human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) -derived cortical neurons exposed to Abeta oligomers. Cross-dataset integration identified convergent therapeutic targets. RESULTS: TSA emerged as the top candidate, protecting neurons from Abeta toxicity and preserving synaptic integrity. DISC1 (Disrupted-In-Schizophrenia 1) was uniquely upregulated across TSA-treated neurons, AD-associated neuronal subpopulations, and protective microglial subtypes. DISCUSSION: DISC1 represents a convergent therapeutic target for AD, mediating TSA's neuroprotective effects through pathways regulating GSK3beta, mitochondrial transport, and synaptic plasticity, providing a mechanistic framework for developing AD therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "Protein misfolding and aggregation are central pathological processes underlying amyloidosis, a group of disorders characterized by the deposition of insoluble amyloid fibrils. These toxic aggregates form due to conformational destabilization and exposure of hydrophobic protein regions, leading to aberrant interactions that disrupt normal cellular functions. Amyloid fibrillation is a key pathological event in both neurodegenerative and systemic disorders. In metabolic and systemic amyloidosis, such as lysozyme derived and insulin derived amyloidosis, peripheral fibril deposition leads to progressive organ dysfunction, while cerebral amyloid accumulation is associated with neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's. To inhibit protein aggregation and destabilize preformed fibrils, a wide range of amyloid inhibitors has been explored. While naturally derived molecules offer some anti-amyloid activity, their limitations have driven growing interest in synthetic and semi-synthetic organic molecules, repurposed drugs, organic dyes, and short peptides. These agents offer enhanced chemical versatility, improved biocompatibility, and the ability to modulate multiple stages of amyloid aggregation. This review provides an overview of the molecular mechanisms of protein misfolding and recent advances in the molecular design, structure-activity relationships, and evaluation of synthetic and semi-synthetic amyloid inhibitors. Using lysozyme and insulin as model systems, we highlight emerging strategies for anti-amyloidogenic intervention.",

    "abstract": "Background: beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) inhibitors demonstrated amyloid-lowering efficacy but failed in phase II/III clinical trials due to adverse effects and limited disease-modifying outcomes. This study employed an integrated network pharmacology and molecular docking approach to quantitatively elucidate the multitarget mechanisms of 4 (phase II/III) discontinued BACE1 inhibitors (Verubecestat, Lanabecestat, Elenbecestat, and Umibecestat) and the preclinical compound AM-6494 in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Methods: Drug-associated targets were intersected with AD-related genes to construct a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, followed by topological analysis to identify hub proteins. Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses were performed using statistically significant thresholds (p < 0.05, FDR-adjusted). Molecular docking was conducted using AutoDock Vina to quantify binding affinities and interaction modes between the selected compounds and the identified hub proteins. Results: Network analysis identified 10 hub proteins (CASP3, STAT3, BCL2, AKT1, MTOR, BCL2L1, HSP90AA1, HSP90AB1, TNF, and MDM2). GO enrichment highlighted key biological processes, including the negative regulation of autophagy, regulation of apoptotic signalling, protein folding, and inflammatory responses. KEGG pathway analysis revealed significant enrichment in the PI3K-AKT-MTOR signalling, apoptosis, and TNF signalling pathways. Molecular docking demonstrated strong multitarget binding, with binding affinities ranging from approximately -6.6 to -11.4 kcal/mol across the hub proteins. Umibecestat exhibited the strongest binding toward AKT1 (-11.4 kcal/mol), HSP90AB1 (-9.5 kcal/mol), STAT3 (-8.9 kcal/mol), HSP90AA1 (-8.5 kcal/mol), and MTOR (-8.3 kcal/mol), while Lanabecestat showed high affinity for AKT1 (-10.6 kcal/mol), HSP90AA1 (-9.9 kcal/mol), BCL2L1 (-9.2 kcal/mol), and CASP3 (-8.5 kcal/mol), respectively. These interactions were stabilized by conserved hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic contacts, and pi-alkyl interactions within key regulatory domains of the target proteins, supporting their multitarget engagement beyond BACE1 inhibition. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that clinically failed BACE1 inhibitors engage multiple non-structural regulatory proteins that are central to AD pathogenesis, particularly those governing autophagy, apoptosis, proteostasis, and neuroinflammation. The identified ligand-hub protein complexes provide a mechanistic rationale for repurposing and optimization strategies targeting network-level dysregulation in Alzheimer's disease, warranting further in silico refinement and experimental validation.",

However, translational efficiency remains critically low. For example, a ClinicalTrials.gov analysis of AD programs (2002-2012) estimated ~99.6% attrition, while PD programs (1999-2019) achieved an overall success rate of ~14.9%. In vitro platforms are assessed, ranging from immortalized neuronal lines and primary cultures to human-induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons/glia, neuron-glia co-cultures (including neuroinflammation paradigms), 3D spheroids, organoids, and blood-brain barrier (BBB)-on-chip systems. Complementary in vivo toxin, pharmacological, and genetic models are discussed for systems-level validation and central nervous system (CNS) exposure realism. The therapeutic synthesis focuses on AD, covering symptomatic drugs, anti-amyloid immunotherapies, tau-directed approaches, and repurposed drug classes that target metabolism, neuroinflammation, and network dysfunction. This review links experimental models to translational decision-making, focusing primarily on AD and providing a brief comparative context from other NDDs. It also covers emerging targeted protein degradation (PROTACs). Key priorities include neuroimmune/neurovascular human models, biomarker-anchored adaptive trials, mechanism-guided combination DMTs, and CNS PK/PD-driven development for brain-directed degraders.",

    "abstract": "Background/Objectives: Empagliflozin (EMPA) was repurposed for Alzheimer's disease (AD) treatment via buccal delivery, exploiting novel nanofibers (NFs) integrating chitosan (Cs), silk fibroin (Fb), and poly(lactic acid) (PLA). Methods: EMPA-loaded Cs/Fb/PLA NFs were electrospun in different formulations to optimize the formulation parameters. The optimized formulation was then investigated for its enhanced in vivo effect. Results: Optimized nanofiber diameters ranged from 459 +/- 173 to 668 +/- 148 nm, possessing bead-free morphology confirmed by SEM and satisfactory mechanical properties. EMPA was successfully well-dispersed in the polymer matrix as evidenced by FTIR, XRD, and drug content. The optimized NFs displayed a hydrophilic surface (contact angle < 90 degrees ), and biphasic drug release with sustained EMPA liberation (84.98% over 24 h). In vivo, buccal EMPA-Cs/Fb/PLA NFs in an AlCl(3)-induced AD rat model significantly reduced brain-amyloid-beta, phosphorylated tau, IL-1beta, and AGER expression by 2.88-, 2.64-, 2.87-, and 2.50-fold, respectively, compared to positive controls, and improved locomotor activity (1.86-fold) and cognitive performance (T-maze) (4.17-fold). Compared to pure EMPA, the nanofiber formulation achieved further reductions in amyloid-beta (1.78-fold), p-tau (1.42-fold), IL-1beta (1.89-fold), and AGER (1.38-fold), with efficacy comparable to memantine. Histopathological examination revealed preservation of the hippocampal neuronal structure. Conclusions: The findings suggest EMPA-loaded Cs/Fb/PLA NFs as a promising non-invasive, sustained-release buccal delivery platform for AD therapy, offering multimodal neuroprotection through modulation of the Abeta-AGER-p-tau axis.",

    "abstract": "With the pharmacokinetics, dosing, safety, and manufacturing of approved or investigational drugs already well-characterized, drug repurposing and repositioning offer emerging strategies to rapidly develop effective treatments for various challenging diseases. However, the growing mass of genetic and multiomics data has not been effectively explored by the drug repurposing community due to a lack of accurate approaches. This review aims to be an authoritative, critical, and accessible review and discussion of general interest to the drug repurposing community concerning the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) tools. Emerging questions include what is achievable with AI in this domain and what its impact will be, what AI and ML embrace, and how we, as geneticists, pharmacologists, and computational scientists, can contribute to the discovery of new, inexpensive, and affordable repurposable medicines. The fast growth of genetics and multiomics data (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and radiomics) and electronic health records in diverse populations contributes to answering questions, including how to rapidly identify effective repurposable medicines, what a clinically meaningful effect size in trials is, and what the potential implications for precision medicine are. This review discusses AI and ML for drug repurposing in the context of genetics, multiomics, real-world data collection, and crowdsourcing of knowledge. We conclude by considering questions on how AI and ML methodologies can unite the diverse aspects of translational medicine for emerging treatment development in human-challenging diseases.",

Computational and integrative analyses that leverage multiomics data provide a promising strategy to uncover disease mechanisms and identify therapeutic opportunities. Here, we develop a cell type-specific regulatory atlas of the human middle temporal gyrus via leveraging single-nucleus RNA-seq (1,197,032 nuclei) and ATAC-seq (740,875 nuclei) datasets from 84 donors across four stages of AD neuropathological change (ADNC). We observe differential gene expression for six major cell types intensified at severe ADNC. Integrating peak-to-gene linkages and motif enrichment analyses, we reconstruct transcription factor (TF)-target gene networks across six major brain cell types. By integrating genome-wide association study (GWAS) loci with cell type-specific cis-regulatory DNA elements (CREs), we pinpoint 141 ADNC-associated genes. Using gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and network proximity analysis, we further identify nine candidate repurposable drugs that were associated with these ADNC-related genes. In summary, this cell type-specific multiomics atlas provides a comprehensive resource for mechanistic understanding, target prioritization, and therapeutic hypothesis generation in AD and AD-related dementia if broadly applied.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is marked by progressive cognitive decline driven largely by tau pathology, yet disease-modifying therapies targeting tau remain limited. In this study, we re-evaluated abemaciclib, a clinically approved CDK4/6 inhibitor for breast cancer and uncovered its previously unrecognized therapeutic potential in AD via CDK4/6-independent mechanisms. Using the APP(NL-F)/MAPT double knock-in mouse model (dKI) and AD patient-derived brain organoids, we found that abemaciclib robustly ameliorates cognitive deficits and reduces neurodegeneration without altering amyloid burden or glial activation. Mechanistically, abemaciclib selectively inhibited key tau kinases, particularly Ca(2)(+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) and glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK3beta), independent of CDK4/6 inhibition, as confirmed by lentiviral knockdown experiments. Furthermore, abemaciclib enhanced autophagic flux and lysosomal activity, promoting clearance of pathological tau proteins. This dual modulation-suppression of tau phosphorylation and facilitation of degradation-highlights abemaciclib as a promising repurposed therapeutic for AD. Our findings establish a novel pharmacological profile for abemaciclib beyond its canonical role in cell cycle control, offering immediate translational potential for tau-targeted AD therapy.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder whose pathogenesis remains incompletely understood. It is considered one of the most costly, fatal, and socially burdensome diseases of the twenty-first century. Previous studies have shown that receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) play an important role in the pathological progression of AD. RTKs regulate amyloid-beta (Abeta) deposition and Tau hyperphosphorylation, thereby influencing neuronal survival, synaptic plasticity, and spatial cognitive function in patients with AD. From a therapeutic perspective, RTK-targeted interventions offer new avenues for AD treatment. Inhibiting specific RTKs can reduce Abeta production and pathological Tau phosphorylation, thereby slowing disease progression. Conversely, activating selected neuroprotective RTKs can promote neuronal survival, restore synaptic function, and ameliorate cognitive impairment. Several small-molecule inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies targeting RTKs have already demonstrated promising therapeutic potential in preclinical studies. Overall, this review systematically summarizes the clinical features and mechanisms of AD, as well as the current applications and future challenges of RTK-based research in neurodegenerative diseases, providing theoretical guidance for the development and repurposing of novel multi-pathway RTK-directed therapies.",

Disruption of either autophagic flux or lysosomal function compromises this degradative pathway and leads to diverse pathological conditions. Emerging evidence identifies the autophagy-lysosome network as a central signaling hub that connects metabolic balance to disease progression, particularly in neurodegenerative disorders and cancer. Although cancer and neurodegenerative diseases exhibit seemingly opposite outcomes-uncontrolled proliferation versus progressive neuronal loss-both share common mechanistic foundations within the autophagy-lysosome axis. Here, we synthesize recent advances on the roles of autophagy and lysosomal mechanisms in neurodegenerative diseases and cancer, especially on how defects in lysosomal acidification, membrane integrity, and autophagosome-lysosome fusion contribute to toxic protein accumulation and organelle damage in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, while the same machinery is repurposed by tumor cells to sustain anabolic growth, stress tolerance, and therapy resistance. We also highlight emerging lysosome-centered therapeutic approaches, including small molecules that induce lysosomal membrane permeabilization, nanomedicine-based pH correction, and next-generation protein degradation technologies. Finally, we discuss the major challenges and future opportunities for translating these mechanistic insights into clinical interventions.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease has few effective therapies, and decades of amyloid- and tau-focused trials have delivered only modest benefit with substantial toxicity. Drug repurposing using real-world data offers a faster and lower-risk route to new treatments, yet current approaches typically average effects across populations, model disease onset and progression separately, and provide little insight into which patients are most likely to benefit. We present CauReL, a dynamic counterfactual representation learning framework that enables transparent, patient specific estimation of treatment effects from large-scale electronic health records for precision drug repurposing in AD. CauReL first learns balanced latent representations of treated and untreated patients using Integral Probability Metric regularization, then jointly predicts two clinically linked outcomes, incident AD and time from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD, to generate paired counterfactual outcomes for every individual. A counterfactual explanation module quantifies how clinical features shape benefit at the patient level, and uplift trees transform complex heterogeneity into simple, rule-based subgroups suitable for trial enrichment and clinical decision support. Using independent cohorts from OneFlorida+ and All of Us, we screened outpatient prescriptions with at least 20 percent exposure among 28,605 individuals with mild cognitive impairment, of whom 4,990 progressed to Alzheimer's disease. CauReL substantially improved covariate balance and distributional overlap across drug cohorts and achieved strong predictive accuracy for both incidence (AUC greater than 0.90) and progression timing (C index 0.81 to 0.84; Spearman 0.80 to 0.86). Twenty drugs showed consistent protective associations, with four emerging as highly reproducible across both networks, the metabolic agents liraglutide and empagliflozin and the neuroactive agents entacapone and amantadine. These drugs were associated with meaningful absolute risk reductions and clinically significant delays in progression from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease. Metabolic drugs produced the strongest benefits in individuals with diabetes, obesity, or cardiovascular disease, whereas neuroactive drugs provided broadly consistent protection across most subgroups. CauReL is available as an open source Python package with a companion web server for direct application to new cohorts or disease settings (https://caurel.site/). This work delivers a scalable and interpretable framework for prioritizing repurposable drugs and designing targeted clinical trials for the patients most likely to benefit.",

    "title": "Targeting neuroinflammation in neurodegenerative disorders: the emerging potential of semaglutide.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Chronic neuroinflammation is increasingly recognized not as a secondary effect but as a primary driver of neurodegenerative disease progression. In conditions such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), multiple sclerosis (MS), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), Huntington's disease (HD), and Lewy body dementia (LBD), dysregulated glial activity, marked by sustained microglial and astrocytic activation, initiates a cascade of cytokine release, oxidative stress, and impaired neuronal support. This review synthesizes recent advances in understanding these shared inflammatory processes, emphasizing how glia-centric pathology shapes disease-specific trajectories and therapeutic responses. FINDINGS: Within this framework, we evaluate the therapeutic potential of semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) with emerging neuroprotective properties. Preclinical studies suggest that semaglutide can suppress pro-inflammatory signaling, mitigate oxidative injury, and enhance key anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective pathways that restore trophic support and cellular resilience. We also examine real-world evidence and emerging human clinical trial data, which recently demonstrated that semaglutide rapidly modulates AD pathology by significantly reducing cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of p-tau, t-tau, and neurogranin, and promoting a less inflammatory CD8(+)T-cell signature. In addition to reduction in neuroinflammation marker, YKL-40. While subsequent large-scale Phase 3 trials in early AD did not meet primary cognitive endpoints (CDR-SB) despite favorable biomarker modulation. CONCLUSION: Positioning semaglutide as a therapeutic option targeting neuroinflammation-mediated neuropathology, this review underscores its potential for repurposing as a disease-modifying therapy across diverse neurodegenerative disorders and highlights the urgent need for targeted trials in MS, ALS, FTD, HD, and LBD-conditions that remain without effective immunomodulatory treatments despite clear inflammatory origins. However, while direct CSF measurements confirm limited but measurable BBB penetration, the clinical translation of its effects remains a key challenge.",

    "abstract": "In quest of new and potent multitarget therapeutics for Alzheimer's disease (AD), a series of recently synthesized arylidene-hydrazinyl-thiazoles were repurposed as multitarget directed anti-AD agents. In total, 14 compounds were tested for their inhibitory activities against the key enzymes acetylcholinesterase (AChE), beta-secretase 1 (BACE1), and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE). Derivatives 8 (IC(50) = 0.117 muM) and 14 (IC(50) = 0.092 muM) showed superior activity against AChE than reference tacrine (IC(50) = 0.274 muM), while compound 13 (IC(50) = 5.35 muM) showed comparable potency against BACE1 to quercetin (IC(50) = 4.89 muM). Nevertheless, compounds 3 and 9 were the most active among the series against BChE. Interestingly, compounds 8, 13, and 14 were considered multitarget ligands against both AChE and BACE1 enzymes. A variable window molecular docking study revealed favorable binding affinities for the thiazole ligands, confirmed by the low ligand-protein binding energies, toward BACE1 and BChE rather than AChE. Compounds 8, 13, and 14 showed BACE1 binding affinities similar to quercetin. On the other hand, compounds 3, 11, and 14 displayed comparable binding conformations to donepezil. Further molecular dynamics simulations revealed stabilization of 8, 13, and 14 complexes inside BACE1, while derivatives 3, 11, and 14 showed stabilizing effects on BChE compared to the apoenzyme. In silico ADMET profiling highlighted the appropriate drug-like properties of the thiazole ligands, which possessed low toxic effects and good pharmacokinetic properties. Overall, the multitarget profile exerted by our thiazole ligands suggests their potential qualification as anti-Alzheimer candidates in AD therapy.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a major neurodegenerative disorder with no definitive cure. Out of several proposed pathophysiology, microbial infection has recently been identified as one of the key pathogenic contributors for the development and progression of AD. In this context, the present study aims at a repurposing strategy through luliconazole (a potent imidazole derivative)-loaded optimized nanoliposomal carriers to treat AD. Optimized luliconazole-loaded nanoliposomes (LuNLs) were developed by the conventional thin-film hydration method followed by characterization in terms of FESEM, AFM, zeta potential, average size, loading %, and drug release (in vitro). The in vivo effectiveness of the LuNLs was investigated in LPS-induced AD rats. Molecular docking and simulation analysis demonstrated a favorable docking score between luliconazole and selected AD proteins. Spherical, nanosized (52.42 nm), negatively charged (-29.9 mV) LuNLs were reported showing a sustained drug release up to 24 h. An in vivo behavioral study depicted improved cognitive behavior in the LuNLs-treated group as compared to control groups. In vivo antioxidant activity in terms of SOD, MDA, and GSH inhibition by LuNLs was found comparable to that of standard formulation-treated groups, depicting the neuroprotective behavior of LuNLs. The histopathological observation of brain tissue in the LuNLs/control group further substantiated the in vivo behavioral study data. Based on the reports, luliconazole may be used as a viable, efficacious alternative for the treatment of AD, though further preclinical studies are highly warranted.",

    "title": "Machine Learning Approaches for Optimizing Drug Combinations in Neurodegenerative Diseases: A Brief Review.",
    "abstract": "As the global population ages, the prevalence of neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs)including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, Multisystem Atrophy (multiple system atrophy), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosiscontinues to rise, largely driven by environmental, metabolic, and lifestyle risk factors. Advances in computational technologies, particularly machine learning (ML) and deep learning, are reshaping research in this field. This review summarizes the major features of these diseases and emphasizes the role of ML in drug discovery, virtual screening, drug repurposing, and drug combination optimization. Representative approaches include support vector machines for classification, convolutional neural networks|convolutional neural network for imaging analysis, recurrent neural networks for temporal biomedical data, and transformers for multimodal integration. These methods highlight the potential of computational strategies to improve therapeutic development. In addition, the review underscores the substantial incidence rates and socioeconomic burden of these conditions, which have made them focal points for algorithmic innovation. With research evolving rapidly, the development of AI-driven approaches is expected to enable more effective, targeted interventions and improve patient outcomes. This Perspective provides a concise overview of current progress and identifies promising future directions in the fight against NDDs.",

    "title": "Effects of Dexmedetomidine on the Behavioral Outcomes in Streptozotocin-Induced Alzheimer's Disease Rats.",
    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive and prevalent neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive cognitive decline and memory impairment. Intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration of streptozotocin (STZ) in rodents recapitulates key features of sporadic AD, including brain insulin resistance and oxidative stress. Dexmedetomidine (Dex), a highly selective alpha2-adrenergic receptor agonist, has demonstrated neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory properties, suggesting its potential utility as a therapeutic approach for AD. METHODS: Seventy adult male Wistar rats were randomly allocated to seven experimental groups: Control, Sham, STZ, Sham + Dex (25 microg/kg), and STZ + Dex (25, 50, 100 microg/kg). Cognitive performance and anxiety-like behaviors were evaluated using the open-field test (OFT), elevated plus maze (EPM), Y-maze test, and Morris water maze (MWM). RESULTS: In the Y-maze, STZ-treated rats exhibited significant reductions in spontaneous alternation behavior (p = 0.002), which were significantly reversed by Dex (25 microg/kg, p = 0.002). In the MWM, the STZ administration resulted in prolonged escape latencies and increased path lengths compared with Control animals (p < 0.05). Treatment with Dex (25 microg/kg) significantly improved spatial learning and memory retention (p < 0.05). No significant differences were observed in locomotor activity and anxiety-related behaviors in the OFT or EPM. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that Dex at 25 microg/kg attenuates STZ-induced cognitive deficits, likely through neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory mechanisms. The results highlight Dex as a promising candidate for AD therapy, though further research is required to elucidate its underlying molecular pathways. The study supports the potential repurposing of Dex for neurodegenerative disorders.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Repurposing Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs could accelerate treatment development for Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: Using the MarketScan claims database (2011 to 2020), we applied a trial emulation approach in two base cohorts: (1) individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI cohort) and (2) individuals aged >/=70 years (over-70 cohort). We evaluated drugs represented in clinical trials for AD, comparing them with same-class or active comparators. Covariate-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated using inverse-probability-weighted Cox models. RESULTS: A total of 6 out of 38 (16%) drugs in the MCI cohort and 10 out of 53 (19%) drugs in the over-70 cohort were associated with a lower AD incidence versus same-class comparators. Active comparator analyses indicated that bupropion (vs escitalopram; HR 0.57, 95% confidence interval [CI] [0.49, 0.66]), trazodone (vs sertraline; HR 0.82, 95% CI [0.74, 0.91]), venlafaxine (vs escitalopram; 0.72, 95% CI [0.62, 0.84]), and zolpidem (vs lorazepam; HR 0.69, 95% CI [0.56, 0.85]) were associated with a lower AD incidence in the MCI cohort; these four plus liraglutide were associated with a lower incidence of AD dementia in the over-70 cohort (vs metformin; HR 0.74, 95% CI [0.59, 0.93]). DISCUSSION: This is the first comprehensive set of trial emulations for FDA-approved drugs that are represented in AD trials. Findings may inform future trial designs. HIGHLIGHTS: Repurposing FDA-approved drugs originally developed for other diseases could accelerate treatment development for AD.We identified repurposable drugs that are in current or complete clinical trials of AD and emulated trials for these agents using a large-scale insurance claims-based database.Among 54 drugs evaluated, 6/38 (16%) drugs in the MCI cohort and 10/53 (19%) in the over-70 cohort were associated with reduced AD incidence versus same-class comparators. Active comparator analyses indicated that bupropion, trazodone, venlafaxine, and zolpidem were associated with reduced AD incidence in the MCI cohort; these four plus liraglutide were associated with a lower incidence of AD dementia in the over-70 cohort.A minority of repurposed table drugs that are in current or completed clinical trials for AD and meet criteria for inclusion in this study showed no effect in our trial emulation studies.This is the first comprehensive set of trial emulations for FDA-approved drugs that are represented in AD trials. Building on our findings, integrating real-world evidence can inform future trials and accelerate drug development for AD.",

    "abstract": "Background: Ovarian cancer has the poorest prognosis of all gynecological malignancies, largely due to its chemoresistance, which poses significant treatment challenges. In this context, drug repurposing emerges as an innovative strategy that employs non-cancer treatments to interact with various signaling pathways, enhancing chemotherapy efficacy while minimizing toxicity. This study investigated the cytotoxic effects of galanthamine, currently used as an Alzheimer's disease, as a potential treatment for high-grade serous carcinoma, both individually and in combination with paclitaxel. Methods: The Presto Blue assay, viability marker assessments, immunocytochemical analysis of apoptosis, and a cumulative assay were employed to evaluate the functionality of P-glycoprotein. Results: The results indicated that galanthamine did not demonstrate cytotoxic or synergistic effects in either high-grade serous carcinoma cell line tested, suggesting that it is not a viable strategy for overcoming paclitaxel resistance in this context. The immunocytochemistry analysis indicated that galanthamine does not affect the expression of proteins related to cell viability and proliferation and is not associated with chemoresistance. Additionally, functional assays showed that galanthamine treatment did not affect its drug efflux function at the cellular level. Conclusions: Overall, the results indicate that galanthamine is unsuitable for reversing paclitaxel resistance despite some literature suggesting its potential interaction with P-glycoprotein.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia, characterized by the deposition of amyloid-beta plaques and neurofibrillary tangles composed of hyperphosphorylated tau. Seizures have also emerged as a prevalent clinical feature of AD and are associated with APOE4, the major genetic risk factor of AD. However, the mechanism by which APOE4 induces seizures and neuronal hyperexcitability is incompletely understood. We discovered that human APOE4 targeted replacement mice showed increased seizure severity and seizure-induced death at 5.5-7 but not 2-3 months of age compared to APOE3 mice using the kainic acid model of status epilepticus which preferentially arises from the hippocampus. While Tau burden alone did not alter seizure susceptibility in mice, APOE4 together with Tau burden enhanced seizure severity in female mice. Notably, APOE4 was associated with decreased hippocampal levels of sodium/potassium-ATPase, ATP-generating glycolytic enzymes, including phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK1) and pyruvate kinase M, and ATP. While inhibition of Na(+)/K(+)- ATPase increased hippocampal neuronal activity, pharmacologically stimulating PGK1 with terazosin increased hippocampal ATP levels and decreased seizure severity in APOE4 but not APOE3 mice. Lastly, co-application of lactate dehydrogenase inhibitor sodium oxamate to prevent the conversion of pyruvate to lactate further enhanced hippocampal ATP levels and suppressed seizure severity in APOE4 mice. Together, these findings suggest that reductions in hippocampal expression of sodium/potassium-ATPase and glycolytic enzymes may underlie APOE4-associated hippocampal hyperexcitability, revealing a novel mechanistic insight. Our results also demonstrate potent anti-seizure effects of terazosin, supporting the possibility of repurposing this anti-hypertension drug to mitigate seizure comorbidity in AD.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Synaptic spine loss in Alzheimer's disease (AD) contributes to cognitive decline. p21-activated kinase 1 (PAK1), a regulator of spine integrity, is aberrantly activated in AD. We investigated whether PAK1 inhibition might preserve dendritic spines in vitro and in vivo. METHODS: Oligomeric amyloid beta (oAbeta) or tau (oTau) were applied to hippocampal neurons +/- NVS-PAK1-1, a selective PAK1 inhibitor. NVS-PAK1-1 was orally administered to 5xFAD mice. The effects of NVS-PAK1-1 treatment on PAK1 activity, spine density, and the proteome were assessed using phospho-PAK1 (pPAK1) western blotting, Golgi staining, and mass spectrometry for proteomic analyses. RESULTS: NVS-PAK1-1 prevented oAbeta and oTau-induced spine loss in vitro. In 5xFAD mice, NVS-PAK1-1 demonstrated brain exposure after oral administration and reduced PAK1 activation, prevented spine loss, and partially normalized synaptic proteomic signatures in females in absence of alterations in brain or plasma Abeta. DISCUSSION: PAK1 inhibition enhances spine resilience in AD models, supporting its therapeutic potential. HIGHLIGHTS: p21-activated kinase 1 (PAK1) inhibitors prevent oligomeric amyloid beta (oAbeta) and oligomeric tau-induced spine loss and dendritic degeneration in cultured mouse hippocampal neurons. NVS-PAK1-1, a selective PAK1 inhibitor, protects against oAbeta-induced spine loss in a dose-dependent manner (EC(50) = 2 nM). Oral administration of NVS-PAK1-1 achieves brain penetration and bioavailability in normal CD-1 mice, and target engagement in 5xFAD mice. Chronic NVS-PAK1-1 treatment mitigates spine loss in the somatosensory cortex of 6-month-old 5xFAD female mice. Chronic treatment with NVS-PAK1-1 restores proteomic abundance of actin cytoskeleton and dendritic spine-associated proteins, including cofilin 2 and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases, downstream of PAK1 in young 5xFAD female mice showing spine resilience. Clinical oncology trials with other PAK1 inhibitors support potential repurposing or novel compound development for Alzheimer's disease trials.",

    "abstract": "Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs), such as the Alzheimer's-associated tau protein, pose challenges for conventional drug discovery. This study applied the Informational Spectrum Method for Small Molecules (ISM-SM), a computational technique utilizing electron-ion interaction potentials (EIIPs), to identify potential tau modulators. Characteristic interaction frequencies derived from known ligands and conserved mammalian tau sequences were used to screen DrugBank and the COCONUT natural product database. The screening identified approved drugs previously reported to indirectly influence tau pathology or Alzheimer's disease pathways, alongside natural products including Bryostatin-14, which is known to modulate kinases involved in tau phosphorylation. These findings suggest that ISM-SM can serve as an in silico tool to identify candidate small molecules, including repurposed drugs and natural products, with potential relevance to tau function and pathology, complementing other IDP drug discovery strategies.",

    "abstract": "Neuroinflammation is a key pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Investigational and FDA approved drugs targeting inflammation already exist, thus drug repurposing for AD is a suitable approach. BT-11 is an investigational drug that reduces inflammation in the gut and improves cognitive function. BT-11 is orally active and binds to lanthionine synthetase C-like 2 (LANCL2), a glutathione-s-transferase, thus potentially reducing oxidative stress. We investigated the effects of BT-11 long-term treatment on the TgF344-AD rat model of AD. BT-11 (1) reduced spatial memory deficits, and hippocampal Abeta plaque load, and increased neuronal levels in males, and reduced microglia numbers in females, and (2) induced transcriptomic changes in signaling receptor, including G-protein coupled receptor pathways in both males and females, with changes in neurotrophic factors only in males. We detected LANCL2 in hippocampal nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions with potentially different post-translational modifications, suggesting distinct functions based on its subcellular localization. LANCL2 was present in oligodendrocytes, indicating a role in oligodendrocyte function. To our knowledge, these last two findings have not been reported. Overall, our data support that targeting LANCL2 with BT-11 improves cognition and reduces AD-like pathology potentially by modulating G-protein signaling. LANCL2's localization in oligodendrocytes suggest a possible role oligodendrocyte function that warrants further investigation. Our studies contribute to the field of new immunomodulatory AD therapeutics and establish LANCL2 as a promising therapeutic target meriting further mechanistic investigation.",

    "abstract": "Neuroinflammation and oxidative stress contribute significantly to cognitive decline, a hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Addressing cognitive decline is a critical medical need, and phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors (PDE5Is) may offer a promising solution. This meta-analysis highlights the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant actions of PDE5Is, which may help counter neuroinflammation and oxidative stress in neurodegenerative diseases including AD. We reviewed over 1,258 studies and considered 34 preclinical rodent studies of inflammation or oxidative stress. Quantitative data on biomarkers such as Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), Interleukin 1 beta (IL-1beta), IL-6, NF-kappaB, IL-10, Superoxide dismutase (SOD), Catalase (CAT), Glutathione peroxidase (GPx), Glutathione (GSH), Malondialdehyde (MDA), Myeloperoxidase (MPO), and caspase-3 was extracted and analyzed using a random-effects model. Study quality was evaluated with a modified CAMARADES checklist, and heterogeneity was assessed using the I(2) statistic. PDE5Is treatment significantly lowered pro-inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress markers, while boosting the levels of critical anti-inflammatory and antioxidant molecules. The pooled standardized mean differences (SMDs) indicated treatment efficacy for nearly all biomarkers. Notably, the studies on Alzheimer's models confirmed similar therapeutic benefits in reducing amyloid burden and enhancing cognitive outcomes. With a strong safety profile and ability to modulate Nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kappaB) and Nuclear erythroid-related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathways, PDE5Is offer promising neuroprotective potential. Thus, repurposing PDE5Is may develop new disease-modifying therapies for Alzheimer's, making clinical investigation crucial.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains a significant challenge in diagnosis and treatment, with current methods insufficient for early detection. A major obstacle is the lack of effective imaging agents targeting the Tau protein, which plays a key role in AD pathology. To address this, we developed a computational methodology for selecting F-18 labeled drug candidates from a library of CNS-penetrant compounds curated from literature and databases. The library, consisting of 977 compounds, was evaluated based on clinical data, target proteins, pathways, toxicity, and other relevant factors. We implemented Python-based algorithms to select the top 39 compounds from virtual screening results, prioritizing those with optimal Tau binding affinity and BBB permeability. Additionally, we developed an algorithm to identify F-18 labeling candidates that maintain their biological activity post-labeling. We then performed virtual screening of an F-18 labeled drug library and selected the top 3 compounds based on stability and imaging potential. The selected compounds exhibited molecular weights of 350-520 Da, favorable logP values (2.05-2.72), and high BBB permeability. Our findings indicate that Drug 388 (BI-D1870), binds to Tau with a binding free energy of DeltaG = -8.79 kcal/mol. Drug 416 (reported BRAF inhibitor, RG6344) shows a binding free energy of DeltaG = -7.91 kcal/mol, while Drug 610 (Iloperidone/HP 873), a D2/5-HT2 receptor antagonist, exhibits a predicted binding free energy of DeltaG = -6.88 kcal/mol with the target Tau protein respectively. Molecular dynamics simulations confirmed stable Tau-drugs interactions, with minimal RMSD fluctuations, indicating strong binding. The F-18 label enabled real-time PET imaging, allowing non-invasive tracking of the drug's binding to Tau in the brain. Our approach provides a comprehensive solution to the current limitations in Alzheimer's diagnosis by offering F-18 labeled drugs that effectively target Tau protein without compromising their biological activity, advancing both diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for AD.",

    "abstract": "Neuroimaging studies have highlighted both hyperconnectivity and hypoconnectivity across the Alzheimer's disease (AD) continuum, alongside task-induced activity changes. These alterations may reflect compensatory mechanisms or network breakdowns. While connectivity-based measures are not yet established as clinical biomarkers, they hold promises for evaluating therapeutic efficacy and informing the design of targeted interventions. Based on these insights, this review explores the potential of off-label FDA-approved drug repositioning as a cost-effective strategy to identify therapeutic approaches for AD. We examine the neurophysiological effects of certain repurposed drugs that modulate synaptic activity, reduce inflammation, enhance metabolic pathways and gut-brain axis interactions, in preclinical and clinical models. Emerging evidence suggests that these drugs (e.g., anticonvulsants, anti-diabetics, anti-inflammatory, and gastrointestinal agents) can influence brain connectivity and activity, mitigating cognitive deficits. By integrating connectivity-focused biomarkers into clinical trials, researchers can advance the development of disease-modifying treatments. This review underscores the importance of a connectivity-driven framework for repurposing existing drugs to address need for new treatments for AD.",

Beyond amyloid, emerging targets include tau, neuroinflammation and neurotransmitters. Targeting neuroinflammation in neurodegenerative diseases has been explored using cyclooxygenase inhibitors, but it has mostly been unsuccessful. Among the drug classes under investigation for AD are the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs), which are approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2D), obesity and cardiovascular disease. GLP-1RAs are candidate treatments for AD based on several concepts. First, epidemiological data reveal that patients with T2D and cardiovascular disease receiving GLP-1RAs have substantial reductions in the risk of developing all-cause dementia. Second, GLP-1RAs reduce neuroinflammatory changes in preclinical models. Clinical trials have not yet shown that GLP-1RAs can slow the rate of cognitive decline in mild cognitive impairment and mild dementia due to AD. Here, we summarize data supporting the use of GLP-1RAs for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, with a focus on AD.",

The compound efficiently reduces both HSV-1-mediated and non-mediated tau phosphorylation or aggregation in vitro and in vivo. The lead compound, as well as conformation-sensitive antibodies, specifically interacts with an oxidized conformer of MIF (oxMIF) enriched in postmortem brain homogenates of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD).

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Lower respiratory infections (LRIs) remain the world's leading infectious cause of death. This analysis from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2023 provides global, regional, and national estimates of LRI incidence, mortality, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), with attribution to 26 pathogens, including 11 newly modelled pathogens, across 204 countries and territories from 1990 to 2023. With new data and revised modelling techniques, these estimates serve as an update and expansion to GBD 2021. Through these estimates, we also aimed to assess progress towards the 2025 Global Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of Pneumonia and Diarrhoea (GAPPD) target for pneumonia mortality in children younger than 5 years. METHODS: Mortality from LRIs, defined as physician-diagnosed pneumonia or bronchiolitis, was estimated using the Cause of Death Ensemble model with data from vital registration, verbal autopsy, surveillance, and minimally invasive tissue sampling. The Bayesian meta-regression tool DisMod-MR 2.1 was used to model overall morbidity due to LRIs. DALYs were calculated as the sum of years of life lost (YLLs) and years lived with disability (YLDs) for all locations, years, age groups, and sexes. We modelled pathogen-specific case-fatality ratios (CFRs) for each age group and location using splined binomial regression to create internally consistent estimates of incidence and mortality proportions attributable to viral, fungal, parasitic, and bacterial pathogens. Progress was assessed towards the GAPPD target of less than three deaths from pneumonia per 1000 livebirths, which is roughly equivalent to a mortality rate of less than 60 deaths per 100 000 children younger than 5 years. FINDINGS: In 2023, LRIs were responsible for 2.50 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 2.24-2.81) deaths and 98.7 million (87.7-112) DALYs, with children younger than 5 years and adults aged 70 years and older carrying the highest burden. LRI mortality in children younger than 5 years fell by 33.4% (10.4-47.4) since 2010, with a global mortality rate of 94.8 (75.6-116.4) per 100 000 person-years in 2023. Among adults aged 70 years and older, the burden remained substantial with only marginal declines since 2010. A mortality rate of less than 60 deaths per 100 000 for children younger than 5 years was met by 129 of the 204 modelled countries in 2023. At a super-regional level, sub-Saharan Africa had an aggregate mortality rate in children younger than 5 years (hereafter referred to as under-5 mortality rate) furthest from the GAPPD target. Streptococcus pneumoniae continued to account for the largest number of LRI deaths globally (634 000 [95% UI 565 000-721 000] deaths or 25.3% [24.5-26.1] of all LRI deaths), followed by Staphylococcus aureus (271 000 [243 000-298 000] deaths or 10.9% [10.3-11.3]), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (228 000 [204 000-261 000] deaths or 9.1% [8.8-9.5]). Among pathogens newly modelled in this study, non-tuberculous mycobacteria (responsible for 177 000 [95% UI 155 000-201 000] deaths) and Aspergillus spp (responsible for 67 800 [59 900-75 900] deaths) emerged as important contributors. Altogether, the 11 newly modelled pathogens accounted for approximately 22% of LRI deaths. INTERPRETATION: This comprehensive analysis underscores both the gains achieved through vaccination and the challenges that remain in controlling the LRI burden globally. Furthermore, it demonstrates persistent disparities in disease burden, with the highest mortality rates concentrated in countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Globally, as well as in these high-burden locations, the under-5 LRI mortality rate remains well above the GAPPD target. Progress towards this target requires equitable access to vaccines and preventive therapies-including newer interventions such as respiratory syncytial virus monoclonal antibodies-and health systems capable of early diagnosis and treatment. Expanding surveillance of emerging pathogens, strengthening adult immunisation programmes, and combating vaccine hesitancy are also crucial. As the global population ages, the dual challenge of sustaining gains in child survival while addressing the rising vulnerability in older adults will shape future pneumonia control strategies.

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) involves progressive cholinergic degeneration, with acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) playing key enzymatic roles in its pathology. In this study, we computationally repurposed four FDA-approved quinolone antibiotics, Norfloxacin, Sparfloxacin, Gatifloxacin, and Nalidixic acid, as potential dual-site cholinesterase (ChE) inhibitors using a hybrid in vitro/in silico workflow. Enzyme inhibition assays identified Norfloxacin as the most potent AChE inhibitor (K(I) = 1.08 muM), while all compounds displayed non-competitive inhibition toward BChE. Molecular docking and MM-GBSA binding free energy analyses revealed key interactions within the catalytic gorge of AChE, supported by hydrogen bonding with Phe295 and Arg296, as well as pi-pi contacts with Tyr124. Density functional theory computations highlighted the influence of frontier orbital distribution on binding affinity, particularly for Norfloxacin and Sparfloxacin. An explicit-solvent molecular dynamics simulation of the AChE-Norfloxacin complex further confirmed the stability of the docking-derived binding mode over 100 ns. In an exploratory fashion, SHAP-based machine learning models were applied to a descriptor set derived from QikProp, SwissADME, and Jaguar outputs, suggesting that BBB-related indices and HOMO energy contribute to AChE inhibition, whereas the energy gap is more relevant for BChE; these trends, however, are constrained by the small four-compound dataset and should be regarded as hypothesis-generating. In silico ADME/Tox profiling indicated favorable oral drug-like properties, low predicted CYP450 inhibition liabilities, and physicochemical profiles compatible with CNS-oriented optimization, although passive BBB permeability was not predicted to be high. Finally, systems-level enrichment (STRING, GeneCards) provided a qualitative network context linking ACHE and BCHE to neurodegeneration. Together, these data position Norfloxacin and Sparfloxacin as computationally prioritised candidates whose ChE-related repurposing potential warrants further validation in dedicated cellular and in vivo models.",

    "title": "An evaluation of Roluperidone as a promising repurposing candidate for Alzheimer's Disease: A Computational Investigation.",
    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most dominant and prevalent form of dementia. The therapeutic agents for AD are not sufficient. Drug repurposing (i.e., also called drug repositioning or therapeutic switching of drugs) could contribute to adding novel therapeutic agents in AD discovery pipeline. Blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a crucial factor, for brain's diseases related drug discovery. Since, CNS active compounds have BBB crossing property, in this study this category of compounds was re-evaluated as repurposing potential candidate for AD by integrated machine learning algorithm, cheminformatics analysis, molecular Docking and simulation-based approach. We builded three machine learning model such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) for the prediction of AD potential repurposing candidates. The SVM classification model performed better than others. The SVM classification model achieved an Area Under the Curve of the Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC-AUC) of 0.81, along with higher precision, recall, and F1 scores. The support vector machine (SVM) was implemented to classify 500 CNS active compounds as AD drug potential and non-AD drug potential. Using the SVM model, 60 compounds were predicted as AD repurposing potential from 500 CNS active compounds. Structural similarity analysis of 60 compounds with Donepezil as a reference drug was performed using 5 different types of fingerprints such as 'substructure', 'extended', 'circular', 'EState', 'MACCS'. 9 compounds from them obtained as structurally most similar to the reference drug. After the molecular docking performance of 9 compounds into the active site & peripheral anionic site of human acetylcholinesterase (hAChE), it was revealed that Roluperidone' had binding affinity of -12 kcal/mol, and 'Napitane' had binding affinity of -11.9 kcal/mol whereas the reference drug Donepezil had a binding affinity of -11.8 Kcal/mol. Molecular dynamics simulation revealed that Roluperionde had better binding integrity to hAChE. This study laid out computational reinvestigation of 500 CNS active drugs for therapeutic switching to AD, and 'Roluperidone' is found as an AD repurposing potential candidate. However, in-vitro and in-vivo studies are further needed to fully elucidate the compound's potential as AD repurposing drugs.",

    "title": "APOE*4 Risk-Modifying Genes and Drug Targets in Alzheimer's Disease through Cell-Type Specific Genomic Analyses.",
    "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: APOE*4 is the strongest, common genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) with widespread and cell-type-specific impact on disease pathogenesis. Genetics and omics studies can help identify genes that counteract the effects of APOE*4, but so far have remained relatively small and crucially did not assess genetic findings through a cell-type-specific framework. OBJECTIVES: Perform a large-scale APOE*4 stratified genome-wide association study (GWAS) of AD integrated with genetically tethered cell-type-specific multi-omics data. DESIGN: Meta-analysis of APOE*4 stratified AD GWAS in case-control, family-based, population-based, and longitudinal AD-related cohorts from the Alzheimer's Disease Genetics Consortium, Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project, and UK Biobank. Integration of GWAS with brain cell-type-specific genetic regulation of gene expression data, from the Religious Orders Study and Memory and Aging Project, to identify APOE*4 and cell-type-specific AD genes. Cell-type-specific multi-omics gene prioritization followed by compound and drug repurposing. Data analyzed between January 2023 and September 2025. SETTING: Genetic data available from high-density single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) microarrays and whole-genome sequencing (WGS). Single-nucleus (sn) RNA-seq data from dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. PARTICIPANTS: 567,521 eligible participants for AD genetic association studies were selected from referred and volunteer samples, of which 119,852 were excluded for analysis exclusion criteria. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES: APOE*4 and cell-type-specific gene Z-scores and FDR-corrected P-values. Gene prioritization scores and APOE*4 stratified enriched compounds. RESULTS: 67 and 17 significant cell-type-gene pairs were identified in APOE*4 non-carriers (APOE*4-) and carriers (APOE*4+) respectively. Oligodendrocytes displayed the largest proportion of APOE*4+ genes. 46 cell-type-gene pairs were supported by at least half of the gene prioritization analyses. Several prioritized genes were druggable and displayed enrichment of APOE*4 stratified drugs or compounds. Top APOE*4+ genes with connections to enriched drugs or compounds included TNS3 (astrocytes), CISD1 and SLC23A2 (oligodendrocytes), and UBXN4 (excitatory neurons). CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: We identified a set of APOE*4 stratified genes that may be causal for AD through brain cell-type-specific mechanisms and prioritized top genes for further interrogation. We additionally identified compounds that may be repurposed or shed light on therapeutic avenues for treating AD based on an individual's APOE*4 status. Top identified compounds such as Hydrocortisone and Trolox implicate oxidative stress and neuroinflammation as potential biological targets in APOE*4+ individuals.",

    "abstract": "Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) is a neurodegenerative disorder affecting lower motor neurons (MNs) and leading to muscle atrophy, due to mutation of the SMN1 gene, which encodes SMN protein. Experimental studies also demonstrated the upper MN impairment. The available approved drugs for SMA increase the SMN protein production. Although effective, outcomes are dependent upon treatment timing and disease severity. Drug repositioning may represent a valid strategy to identify new treatments by repurposing FDA/EMA-approved drugs that, combined with the available ones, could delay neurodegeneration. To this aim, for the first time we used primary cortical neurons derived from the SMNDelta7 mice as defective in vitro disease model, to preliminary assess drug efficacy on neuronal survival and morphology. Under basal conditions, SMA cortical neurons showed significantly reduced vitality and altered morphology compared to WT neurons. All the parameters were rescued after treatment with known compounds (Valproic Acid, 4-aminopyridine and N-acetylcysteine), already tested in either preclinical or clinical context for SMA. We then investigated for the first time in SMA pathology the efficacy of 10H-phenothiazine (10H-PTZ), known to exert neuroprotection and to target altered mechanisms in Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease. Its administration to SMA cortical neurons induced significant protective effects on both neuronal survival and morphology that were further confirmed in vivo, in a C. elegans SMA model. Overall, our results provide valuable insights, both in vitro and in vivo, into the potential of 10 H-PTZ repurposing for SMA, although additional functional studies will be required.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains one of the most challenging neurodegenerative disorders, with limited therapeutic options and high failure rates in clinical trials. This work developed a drug repurposing pipeline powered by a machine learning (ML) model to find possible glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK-3beta) inhibitors, a crucial target in AD pathogenesis. We selected, pre-processed, and optimized a dataset of 4,087 experimentally verified GSK-3beta inhibitors using dimensionality reduction and descriptor creation. The most excellent prediction performance was obtained by Random Forest (100 descriptors) out of six supervised ML algorithms that were studied (R(2) = 0.8178, RMSE = 0.8118, MAE = 0.6084). Following the virtual screening of 1,616 Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs using this refined model, many compounds with projected IC(5)(0) < 500 nM were found. Docking experiments showed insightful interactions and high binding affinities with the active-site residues of GSK-3beta. With the best docking score (-9.3 kcal/mol), stable molecular dynamics (Average RMSD values (1000 ns): protein, 2.23 +/- 0.93 A; protein-ligand complex, 1.40 +/- 0.43 A) and long-lasting contacts with crucial residues, dolutegravir stood out among the top choices. ADMET profiling validated good pharmacokinetics and safety characteristics; however, possible hepatotoxicity needs more research. A HOMO-LUMO gap of 3.07 eV was found by density functional theory (DFT) analysis, indicating robust electron transport characteristics and balanced reactivity that are favorable for protein-ligand interaction. Together, these findings show that dolutegravir is a potential repurposable option against AD and how integrative ML, docking, MD, ADMET, and quantum chemistry techniques may speed up the identification of new drugs.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The development of effective disease-modifying therapies for Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains a critical unmet need. While Mendelian randomization (MR) has been leveraged to identify genetic variants to accelerate AD target discovery, previous studies have been limited by narrow phenotypic coverage, insufficient multiomics validation, and inadequate mechanistic exploration. This study aims to overcome these limitations via comprehensive MR to identify robust therapeutic targets. METHODS: We performed an integrative multiomics MR analysis leveraging over 50 genome-wide association study (GWAS) datasets spanning AD, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers (Abeta42, p-tau), neuroimaging endophenotypes, cognitive traits, and risk factors. Blood/CSF/brain protein quantitative trait loci (pQTLs) from large-scale proteomics studies were analyzed to identify druggable targets. A rigorous validation cascade was subsequently performed: Bayesian colocalization was performed to assess whether the same variants are associated with the protein and other traits; summary-data-based MR was performed to distinguish pleiotropy from linkage; mediation analysis was performed to quantify biomarker-driven causal pathways; integrated analysis of multiomics (single-cell RNA-seq and proteome) data was performed to resolve cellular specificity, and (PPI) interaction networks were generated; phenome-wide MR (Phe-MR) was performed across 679 traits to evaluate on-target side effects; and structure-based druggability screening was conducted. RESULTS: Proteome-wide MR analysis revealed 15 potential drug targets for AD; six of these targets (PILRA, GRN, ACE, TIMD3, TREM2) were validated as Tier 1 (highest-confidence targets with external validation and causal consistency). Mediation analysis revealed that IDUA reduced the risk of AD through Abeta42 and p-tau in the CSF, whereas Siglec-7/9 increased the risk of AD through p-tau in the CSF. Additional targets revealed associations with AD biomarkers, neuroimaging, and cognitive function. Single-cell analysis highlighted the enrichment of key microglial and astrocyte targets. PPI network analysis revealed interaction pathways between seven drug targets and four AD therapeutics, and druggability assessment revealed seven potential therapeutics. CONCLUSIONS: This study established a comprehensive AD target atlas, revealing mechanism-anchored targets that were validated across multiomics analyses and a clinically actionable framework integrating efficacy, biology, and safety profiling. Overall, these results advance AD drug discovery by revealing prioritized targets with causal biological support and providing a validated development roadmap.",

    "abstract": "Neuroinflammation is a key driver of Alzheimer's disease and an emerging therapeutic target. The p38/MK2 pathway regulates microglial cytokine production, yet previous attempts have not yielded modulators with clinically suitable properties. Here, we apply an integrative structure-guided and screening strategy to identify small-molecule disruptors of the p38/MK2 protein-protein interaction (PPI). Virtual screening of FDA-approved drugs prioritized nilotinib, a BCR-ABL inhibitor, as a putative PPI disruptor. Biochemical and molecular dynamics analyses confirmed that nilotinib binds to p38, blocks MK2 association, and suppresses cytokine release in microglia. Guided by these findings, we developed a lysate-based TR-FRET ultrahigh-throughput assay that identified additional inhibitors, including alpha(1)-adrenergic antagonists doxazosin, terazosin, and alfuzosin. These compounds suppressed cytokine induction via docking groove blockade. Together, these results establish a non-ATP-competitive approach for selectively targeting the p38/MK2 complex and highlight the translational potential of drug repurposing to modulate neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's disease.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia, characterized by progressive oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and cognitive decline. Current pharmacological therapies are largely symptomatic, underscoring the need for new disease-modifying strategies. Drug repurposing provides an efficient approach to exploiting clinically approved compounds with established safety. Hence, in the current study, we investigated the neuroprotective potential of cefotaxime (CTX), a third-generation cephalosporin antibiotic, in an intracerebroventricular streptozotocin (ICV-STZ) rat model of AD. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were administered CTX (100-300 mg/kg, intraperitoneal, 28 days) and compared with donepezil (5 mg/kg). Behavioral performance was assessed using the Morris water maze, Y-maze, elevated plus maze, and open field tests. Biochemical assays (oxidative stress markers), histopathology, immunohistochemistry, ELISA, and RT-PCR were employed to examine molecular and cellular changes. CTX significantly ameliorated STZ-induced cognitive deficit, anxiety-like behaviors, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation. While CTX reduced mRNA expression of beta-amyloid and tau, it did not lower their protein levels as determined by ELISA, suggesting selective modulation at transcriptional rather than post-translational levels. Together, these findings suggest a potential role for CTX as a promising repurposed candidate for alleviating AD-related neurobehavioral deficits through the modulation of oxidative stress and inflammatory pathways.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by amyloid-beta plaques and tau neurofibrillary tangles, with tau pathology being closely linked to cognitive decline. Growing evidence suggests that metabolic dysfunction including type 1 diabetes (T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D), as well as prediabetes (PreDM), exacerbate AD by promoting different degrees of insulinopenia, insulin resistance and hyperglycemia which can drive chronic inflammation and oxidative stress across multiple organs. Precisely how these metabolic disturbances influence tau phosphorylation remains unclear. To address this, we studied mouse models of AD, T1D, PreDM, T2D and the combination of AD with all three metabolic alterations, at 26 weeks of age, when pathologies are well established. The fact that we are including models of insulin resistance and insulin deficiency allows us to further explore the specific role of insulin as observed in the clinic. We assessed metabolic status, tau phosphorylation and cytokine levels in the brain cortex and cognitive function using the Morris water maze (MWM) and novel object discrimination (NOD) tests. Our results revealed that AD mice with metabolic disorders exhibited tau hyperphosphorylation, particularly at Ser199, Ser202/Thr205 and Ser404, correlating with metabolic dysfunction, cognitive impairment and inflammatory markers. Notably, AD-T2D mice showed the most severe deficits in MWM and NOD performance, indicating a synergistic cognitive decline. Machine learning analysis by random forest effectively classified AD-metabolic phenotypes, identifying key molecular and metabolic markers of neurodegeneration, mainly blood glucose and plasma insulin. These findings highlight the critical role of metabolic dysfunction in exacerbating tau pathology and accelerating cognitive decline in AD. Targeting metabolic pathways may provide concomitant therapeutic opportunities for AD patients with diabetes. Future research should explore interventions that restore insulin signaling and glucose metabolism to mitigate AD progression, probably by repurposing antidiabetic drugs.",

    "abstract": "Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) plays a crucial role in inflammatory responses and has been implicated in neuroinflammatory processes associated with neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. While selective COX-2 inhibitors (coxib class of drugs) have been developed, their use is limited by adverse effects, necessitating the exploration of alternative therapeutic approaches. This study investigates the potential of curcumin derivatives as COX-2 inhibitors and their possible therapeutic applications in neurological disorders. Previous in silico studies show various amino acids interacting with naturally occurring curcumin derivatives. We explored the potential of 2561 curcumin derivatives as COX-2 enzyme inhibitors by examining their binding affinity to the protein. Using molecular docking, we assessed their interactions with two regions of COX-2, identifying five standout compounds with powerful binding affinities. The binding energies of these compounds lie around -10.7 and -10.6 kcal/mol. To better understand how these top candidates behave in a dynamic biological environment, we ran molecular dynamics simulations focusing on their interactions with one part of the enzyme. These simulations revealed that the compounds formed stable complexes with COX-2, maintaining consistent hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic contacts throughout. RMSD and RMSF graphs exhibit greater stability of these compounds as compared to the control molecule. Finally, energy calculations confirmed that these interactions were not only stable but also energetically favorable, suggesting that several curcumin derivatives could be promising COX-2 inhibitors. This study provides valuable insights into the potential of curcumin derivatives as COX-2 inhibitors and their possible therapeutic applications in neurological disorders. The identified compounds warrant further investigation through in vitro and in vivo studies to validate their efficacy and safety as potential alternatives to current selective COX-2 inhibitors in the treatment of neuroinflammatory conditions.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) are increasingly used for symptom monitoring and care delivery, yet their prognostic value for identifying patients at higher risk for mortality in neurological populations is unclear. This systematic review evaluated whether PROMs predict mortality and/or survival in adults with neurological conditions. METHODS: We systematically searched MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (January 2002-November 2024) for studies incorporating PROMs into mortality or survival prediction models across 10 neurological conditions: motor neuron disease, diabetic neuropathy, nervous system cancers, Alzheimer's and other dementias, Guillain-Barre syndrome, epilepsy, headache, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, and stroke. Screening, data extraction, and risk-of-bias assessment followed the CHARMS and PRISMA guidelines. Findings were descriptively summarized. RESULTS: Of 6,218 abstracts reviewed, 49 studies met the inclusion criteria. Most evaluated stroke (n = 16), nervous system cancers (n = 14), or motor neuron disease (n = 9). None evaluated headache, diabetic neuropathy, Guillain-Barre syndrome, or epilepsy. Of the included studies, 26 used generic PROMs, 19 used condition-specific PROMs, and 4 included both. Across conditions, PROMs independently predicted mortality in three-quarters of studies, with the strongest evidence observed in nervous system cancers and motor neuron disease. By instruments, EORTC QLQ in brain cancers and SF-36 in stroke showed the most consistent prognostic utility. Among studies with mixed findings by domain, physical health components were more likely to predict mortality than emotional components. CONCLUSION: PROMs independently predict mortality in several neurological conditions, though prognostic value varied by condition and instrument type. Future studies should evaluate their additive value and feasibility for integration into prognostic models in routine care.",

    "title": "Insulin Signaling in Alzheimer's Disease: Association with Brain Insulin Resistance.",
    "abstract": "Insulin is an anabolic hormone involved in the regulation of several processes, such as the storage of glucose into glycogen, decrease of glucose output, stimulation of glucose transport into cells, etc. The hormone binds to its receptor, thereby activating an intracellular signaling cascade. Once activated, the insulin receptor (INSR) phosphorylates multiple intracellular substrates, which initiate the downstream signaling pathway. The nature of insulin signaling pathways may vary depending on the organ or tissue. In the central nervous system (CNS), INSRs are expressed in all cell types. This observation may suggest that insulin signaling is involved in important and diverse processes. It regulates glucose metabolism, supports cognitive functions, enhances the outgrowth of neurons, as well as plays a role in the modulation of release and uptake of catecholamine, among other roles. Importantly, insulin can freely cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) from the circulation and is also synthesized locally within the brain. Insulin resistance (IR) impairs insulin signaling, which may accelerate brain aging, affect plasticity, and potentially contribute to neurodegeneration. Dysregulation of insulin signaling has been implicated in several diseases, including diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome, certain cancers, and neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease. There are two principal insulin signaling pathways: the PI3K/AKT pathway, primarily associated with metabolic effects, and the MAPK pathway, which is involved in cell growth, survival, and gene expression. Our review describes the role of insulin in the human brain, as well as the disturbances in insulin signaling resulting from brain insulin resistance, with a particular focus on its association with Alzheimer's disease.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Xanthohumol (XN), a prenylated chalcone flavonoid derived from hops (Humulus lupulus), is increasingly recognized as a highly pleiotropic natural compound. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to structure XN's mechanistic hierarchy with emerging translational relevance across disease areas. METHODS: We performed a comprehensive and integrative literature review of XN for its biological and translational effects across cancer, metabolic, neurological, cardiovascular, hepatic, renal, and dermatological disorders. RESULTS: Mechanistically, XN exerts diverse bioactivities by inhibiting major pro-oncogenic and pro-inflammatory pathways, such as NF-kappaB, PI3K/Akt/mTOR, STAT3, HIF-1alpha, and selective MAPK cascades, while activating cytoprotective signaling, such as the Nrf2/ARE and AMPK pathways. Through these coordinated actions, XN modulates redox homeostasis, mitochondrial integrity, apoptosis, autophagy, ferroptosis, and inflammatory responses. In oncology, XN demonstrates broad-spectrum anticancer activity in preclinical models by inhibiting proliferation; inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis; suppressing epithelial-mesenchymal transition, angiogenesis, and metastasis; and restoring chemosensitivity in resistant cancers, including breast, lung, gastric, liver, and head-and-neck carcinomas. Beyond cancer, XN exhibits multi-organ protective bioactivities through antioxidative, antimicrobial, antiviral, and anti-inflammatory activities; inhibition of ferroptosis and excitotoxicity; and preservation of mitochondrial integrity. It shows beneficial effects in preclinical models of Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, hepatic steatosis and fibrosis, renal ischemia-reperfusion injury, cardiovascular dysfunction, skin photoaging, and atopic dermatitis. Human subject studies demonstrate that XN is safe and well tolerated, with observed reductions in oxidative DNA damage and inflammatory cytokine release. Recent advances in micellar formulations have improved XN's systemic bioavailability and thus its translational feasibility. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, XN is a safe, multifunctional natural compound with strong potential for modulating disease-relevant biological pathways associated with cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, metabolic disorders, and inflammatory skin conditions. Continued efforts to enhance its bioavailability and conduct rigorous clinical trials are essential to fully establish its clinical relevance in patient populations.",

    "title": "Serotonin, Kynurenine, and Indole Pathways of Tryptophan Metabolism in Humans in Health and Disease.",
    "abstract": "Tryptophan (TRP) is a proteinogenic and nutritionally essential amino acid involved in the formation of numerous bioactive substances. A crucial role in the TRP molecule is played by indole, a bicyclic ring formed by benzene and pyrrole, which confers hydrophobic and antioxidant properties and the ability to act as a ligand for aryl hydrocarbon and pregnane X receptors. The first parts of the article examine sources, nutritional requirements, and three pathways of TRP catabolism. Physiologically, ~5% of dietary TRP is catabolized through the pathway forming serotonin and melatonin in the brain and enterochromaffin cells of the gut, ~85% through the pathway resulting in the formation of nicotinamide nucleotides and kynurenine and its derivatives in the liver and immune cells, and ~10% in gut microbiota to indole derivatives. Alterations of individual TRP catabolism pathways in aging, alcoholism, inflammatory bowel disease, metabolic syndrome, renal insufficiency, liver cirrhosis, cancer, and nervous diseases, e.g., depression, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, multiple sclerosis, and schizophrenia, are examined in the central section. The final sections are devoted to the benefits and adverse effects of TRP supplementation, the therapeutic use of various TRP metabolites, and the pharmacological targeting of enzymes, transporters, and receptors involved in TRP catabolism. It is concluded that all pathways of TRP catabolism are altered across a broad spectrum of human illnesses, and further investigation is needed to understand their role in disease pathogenesis better. The goal for clinical research is to explore options for TRP-targeted therapies and their integration into new therapeutic strategies.",

    "abstract": "Diet plays a central role in shaping the composition and metabolic activity of the oral microbiota, thereby influencing both oral and systemic health. Disturbances in this delicate host-microbe balance, triggered by dietary factors, smoking, poor oral hygiene, or antibiotic use, can lead to microbial dysbiosis and increase the risk of oral diseases such as periodontitis, as well as chronic systemic disorders including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer's disease, and certain cancers. Among dietary contaminants, exposure to toxic heavy metals such as cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), mercury (Hg), nickel (Ni), and arsenic (As) represents an underrecognized modifier of the oral microbial ecosystem. Even at low concentrations, these elements can disrupt microbial diversity, promote inflammation, and impair metabolic homeostasis. Saliva has recently emerged as a promising, non-invasive biofluid for monitoring nutritional status and early metabolic alterations induced by diet and environmental exposures. Salivary biomarkers, including metabolites, trace elements, and microbial signatures, offer potential for assessing the combined effects of diet, microbiota, and toxicant exposure. This review synthesizes current evidence on how diet influences the oral microbiota and modulates susceptibility to heavy metal toxicity. It also examines the potential of salivary biomarkers as integrative indicators of nutritional status and metabolic health, highlights methodological challenges limiting their validation, and outlines future research directions for developing saliva-based tools in personalized nutrition and precision health.",

    "abstract": "Pteridium aquilinum (L.) Kuhn, known as bracken fern, is considered a poisonous plant due to its toxic substances. This species contains toxic substances and enzymes: thiaminase and an anti-thiamine substance, which cause thiamine deficiency syndrome. Prunasin induces acute cyanide poisoning. Ptaquiloside causes haematuria, retinal atrophy, immunodeficiency, and lymphoproliferative disorders. It also induces carcinogenesis in livestock, and in animals and human cell lines. Ptaquiloside has been found in the milk of cattle, goats, and sheep that grazed on P. aquilinum in pastures. Ptaquiloside is water-soluble and washes away from the plants into the soil with rainwater. It has been found in streams and groundwater wells. The International Agency for Research on Cancer has classified bracken fern as a Group 2B carcinogen. However, P. aquilinum has long been used as a folk remedy in various regions. Several studies have identified its medicinal value and bioactive compounds with potential pharmacological activity. Pterosin B and its analogues exhibit anti-osteoarthritis, anti-Alzheimer's disease, neuroprotective, anti-cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, anti-diabetic, and smooth muscle relaxant properties. Ptaquiloside also induces apoptosis in certain human cancer cell lines and acts as an anticancer agent. Therefore, pterosins and ptaquiloside have therapeutic properties. Other compounds, including some flavonoids and polysaccharides, act as antimicrobial, antifungal, and immunomodulatory agents. Based on their structures, it is possible to develop medicines with these therapeutic properties, particularly those containing pterosins and ptaquiloside. However, more research is needed on their use in medicinal treatments.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The association and mechanisms between biotin and dementia remain unclear. METHODS: We investigated the association through a population and animal study. UK Biobank data were used to evaluate the association of biotin with incident dementia and brain structural alteration. To validate our findings, we established a biotin-deficient mouse model, and performed behavioural tests, immunofluorescence, RT-qPCR, Western blotting, and molecular docking. FINDINGS: In humans, higher biotin intake was significantly associated with reduced risks of all-cause dementia (moderate: 0.83 [0.74-0.94]; high: 0.78 [0.68-0.89]), Alzheimer's disease (AD, moderate: 0.74 [0.61-0.89]; high: 0.79 [0.64-0.98]), and delayed-onset dementia (DOD, moderate: 0.810 [0.715-0.918]; high: 0.776 [0.672-0.896]), but not vascular dementia (VD) and early-onset dementia (EOD). Neuroimaging results revealed a \"pseudo-atrophy\" pattern-reduced cortical volume with increased tissue intensity-resembling structural remodelling rather than neurodegeneration. In mice, biotin deficiency triggered region-specific alteration of APP, PSEN1, and APOE in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. It was accompanied by elevated Abeta42 levels and an increased Abeta42/40 ratio. Molecular docking suggested that biotin physically interacts with the catalytic pocket of PSEN1 and the receptor-binding domain of APOE. INTERPRETATION: Dietary biotin is associated with a lower risk of dementia, especially AD, potentially by inhibiting amyloidogenic processing and modulating APOE-mediated clearance. The observed neuroimaging and molecular patterns suggest that maintaining adequate biotin intake is a viable strategy for dementia prevention.

    "title": "The Impact of Zinc on Cellular Dynamics, Brain Function, and its Therapeutic Potential in Neuronal Regeneration.",
    "abstract": "Zinc is a vital trace element that plays a central role in maintaining brain function, regulating cellular dynamics, and promoting neuronal repair. As the second most abundant transition metal in the central nervous system, zinc is essential for neurotransmission, synaptic plasticity, and neurogenesis, processes that underlie higher cognitive functions such as learning and memory. Its homeostasis is tightly controlled, as dysregulation contributes to the onset and progression of neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. At the cellular level, zinc serves as a critical regulator of proliferation, differentiation, and survival, influencing the behavior of neural and mesenchymal stem cells. Through modulation of signaling pathways such as PI3K/Akt and MAPK, zinc governs cell growth, maturation, and neuroprotection. Physiological levels support axonal sprouting, neurite extension, and synaptic connectivity, whereas excessive release under pathological conditions exacerbates oxidative stress and excitotoxicity. Emerging evidence highlights zinc's therapeutic role in neuronal regeneration. Controlled supplementation enhances neurogenesis, reduces apoptosis, restores synaptic activity, and improves memory outcomes in experimental models of neural injury. Zinc-enriched biomaterials and scaffolds are also being developed for neural tissue engineering, where the incorporation of zinc enhances neurite outgrowth, cell adhesion, and network repair. Beyond neuroregeneration, zinc-based nanomaterials are gaining biomedical significance. Zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) exhibit potent anticancer activity against human cancer cell lines by inducing reactive oxygen species generation, DNA damage, and apoptosis. Additionally, other zinc nanoparticles, including zinc sulfide and zinc-doped biomaterials, show potential in tissue repair, wound healing, and drug delivery applications. Collectively, these findings underscore zinc's multifaceted role in neural function, regenerative biology, and nanomedicine. Advancing our understanding of zinc-mediated mechanisms may enable the development of novel zinc-targeted therapeutic strategies for treating neurodegenerative diseases and promoting functional recovery after brain injury.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) involves complex regulatory disruptions across multiple brain cell types, yet the comprehensive intracellular causal mechanisms remain poorly understood. METHODS: We present an integrative analysis framework using single-nucleus transcriptomics with matched subject-level genotype data from 272 AD patients in the Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP) and construct causality-based, cell-type-specific gene regulatory networks (GRNs). RESULTS: Our method identifies regulatory genes among transcription factors (TFs) and non-TFs, generating a complete and accurate causal regulatory map across brain cell types. Our analyses reveal both established and novel regulations, pathways, and cell-type-specific hub genes in AD. Beyond constructing transcriptome-wide GRNs, we quantitatively evaluate hub genes and distinguish those with regulatory versus responsive roles. DISCUSSION: Our study provides a comprehensive map of cell-type-specific causal GRNs in AD, with a methodology applicable to other complex diseases such as cancer, enabling dynamic pathway exploration, hypothesis generation, and functional interpretation. HIGHLIGHTS: Comprehensive causal regulatory maps across six brain cell types revealed cell-type-specific regulatory mechanisms that move beyond traditional correlation-based and TF-centric model limitations. Novel and established hub genes and functional modules were compared across cell types, providing insights into cellular functions related to AD. Hub gene roles as regulators or targets were quantitatively evaluated within cell-type GRNs. The constructed GRNs show upstream non-TF genes regulating TFs and interconnected TF regulatory modules, highlighting the complexity of AD regulatory mechanisms beyond TF-centric assumptions.",

    "abstract": "Src homology 2 domain-containing inositol-5 phosphatase 2 (SHIP2) is a key player in regulating the signaling by phosphoinositides and is involved in the modulation of cellular functions such as proliferation, adhesion, migration, and survival. SHIP2 works by dephosphorylating PIP(3) to modulate the PI3K/AKT pathway, which plays a role in different standard and pathological conditions. SHIP2 appears to play a dual part in cancer, serving as a tumor suppressor in some instances and a tumor promoter in others. It is also involved in neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. To understand the molecular mechanism of SHIP2, we solved its cryogenic electron microscopy (cryoEM) structure. Unexpectedly, the SHIP2 pleckstrin homology-related domain was found to associate with its C2 and phosphatase domains. This arrangement enables the catalytic domain to interact with the substrate, especially at higher concentrations of PIP(3) or PI(3,4)P(2). Furthermore, SHIP2 forms oligomers on the membrane. Our findings suggest a mechanism by which SHIP2 activity may be regulated through interactions with membrane lipids. This provides structural insights into how domain organization and membrane association regulate its function in various physiological contexts.",

    "abstract": "Multi-omics datasets capture complementary aspects of biological systems and are central to modern machine learning applications in biology and medicine. Existing graph-based integration methods typically construct separate graphs for each omics type and focus primarily on intra-omic relationships. As a result, they often overlook cross-omics regulatory signals-bidirectional interactions across omics layers-that are critical for modeling complex cellular processes. A second major challenge is missing or incomplete omics data; many current approaches degrade substantially in performance or exclude patients lacking one or more omics modalities. To address these limitations, we introduce MultiGEOmics , an intermediate-level graph integration framework that explicitly incorporates regulatory signals across omics types during graph representation learning and models biologically inspired omics-specific and cross-omics dependencies. MultiGEOmics learns robust cross-omics embeddings that remain reliable even when some modalities are partially missing. We evaluated MultiGEOmics across eleven datasets spanning cancer and Alzheimer's disease, under zero, moderate, and high missing-rate scenarios. MultiGEOmics consistently maintains strong predictive performance across all missing-data conditions while offering interpretability by identifying the most influential omics types and features for each prediction task.

However, the involvement of PSEN1 in breast cancer remains unclear. This study was conducted to explore the function and related mechanisms of PSEN1 in breast cancer cells. METHODS: The correlation between two genes was determined utilizing the R2 platform, and the association between gene expression and prognosis was analyzed employing the Kaplan-Meier plotter. The expression of PSEN1 in breast cancer was assessed by in immunofluorescence. The Transwell assay was employed to detect the migration and invasion capabilities of cells. Colony formation and EdU staining were employed to evaluate the effects of PSEN1 on breast cancer cell proliferation. RESULTS: We observed a positive correlation between the expression of PSEN1 and the prognosis of breast cancer patients. After manipulated the expression of PSEN1 in breast cancer cell lines Sum159 and BT549, we found that PSEN1 could inhibit cell proliferation and growth in breast cancer through colony formation assays and EdU staining. Meanwhile, we revealed that interference with the cell cycle by PSEN1 was associated with cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CKIs) in breast cancer samples. Furthermore, we observed that an increase in PSEN1 expression inhibited the invasive capabilities of breast cancer cells, while a decrease in PSEN1 expression enhanced invasion in both Sum159 and BT549 cell lines. Lastly, we discovered a negative correlation between PSEN1 and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) transcription factors as well as markers in breast cancer patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that PSEN1 inhibits the invasion and proliferation of breast cancer cells, suggesting that PSEN1 could potentially serve as a prognostic biomarker and a novel therapeutic target for patients with breast cancer.",

Impairment of microglial autophagy-lysosomal pathway (ALP) is increasingly recognized as a key driver of the disease progression. Transcription factor EB (TFEB), a master regulator of ALP, has emerged as a promising therapeutic target; however, its specific role in microglia remains unclear. Here, we aimed to determine the therapeutic effects of microglial TFEB expression in AD pathogenesis. We established a tamoxifen-inducible, microglia-specific TFEB-overexpressing 5xFAD mouse line (5xTFEB) and conducted behavioural testing, histopathology and biochemical analyses, live-cell imaging of Abeta phagocytosis, and bulk RNA sequencing. Differential gene expressions were analysed, and inflammasome activation was evaluated. Microglial TFEB overexpression restored ALP function, promoted phagolysosomal clearance of oligomeric Abeta, and reduced the amyloid burden in the cortex, hippocampus, and entorhinal cortex of the 5xFAD mice. These changes rescued memory deficits in both male and female 5xTFEB mice. Transcriptomic profiling revealed upregulation of ALP and downregulation of inflammatory signalling. Additionally, inflammasome activation was attenuated in 5xTFEB mice. Targeted TFEB activation in microglia reprograms degradative and immune pathways, enhancing Abeta clearance while alleviating neuroinflammation and cognitive impairment in AD. Overall, microglial TFEB modulation is a promising cell-type-specific therapeutic strategy for AD and related neurodegenerative disorders.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are highly conserved multifunctional signaling proteins with pleotropic effects throughout embryonic development. BMPs are aberrantly expressed in many diseases including cancer and Alzheimer's disease. Recent studies suggested that BMP signaling negatively regulates mitochondrial bioenergetics. The mechanisms by which BMP signaling regulates bioenergetics and cell survival are not known. METHODS: We utilized BMP type 2 receptor (BMPR2) inhibitor (JL189), BMPR2 kinase domain KO, BMPR2 siRNA, and BMP loss of function mutants in C. elegans to inhibit BMP signaling (BMPR2i). The effects of BMPR2i on mitochondrial bioenergetics were examined by measuring differences in TCA cycle intermediates (mass spectrometer), mitochondrial respiration (Agilent Seahorse), and mitochondrial mass (MitoTracker Green/TFAM). Fluorescent mitochondrial Ca(2+) sensors Rhod-2AM and LAR-GECO were used to detect changes in mitochondrial Ca(2+) levels in cell culture and C elegans respectively. The KO and siRNA of the mitochondria uniporter (MCU) were used to determine the mechanisms BMPR2i regulates the uptake of Ca(2+) into the mitochondria. We compared the responses of BMPR2i in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines, leukemia cells, breast cancer cells, and HT-22 mouse hippocampal cells to assess whether the biological response varied depending on the cell type. RESULTS: BMPR2i increased mitochondrial Ca(2+) (mtCa(2+)) levels in all cells lines and in C. elegans, suggesting its regulation of Ca(2+) transport is conserved. BMPR2i induced increase in mtCa(2+) levels were dependent on the MCU, which effected mitochondrial bioenergetics and cell survival. In addition, our data suggests that BMPR2 regulation of mtCa(2+) transport is mediated by TAK1-d splice variant. In leukemia cells, BMPR2i induced significant cell death that was attenuated by MCU KO. In NSCLC and HT-22 cells, BMPR2i increased mitochondrial bioenergetics and induced minimal cell death. CONCLUSION: These studies reveal that BMPR2 signaling regulates TAK1-d splice variant to mediate mitochondrial Ca(2+) transport, which is dependent on the MCU. Our studies suggest that BMPR2 signaling utilizes mtCa(2+) transport to regulate both mitochondrial bioenergetics and/or cell survival. Our studies provide novel insight into how aberrant BMPR2 signaling is pathogenic and suggests that the response could vary depending on the cell type.",

    "abstract": "Lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2), also known as phospholipase A2 group VII (PLA2G7), is an enzyme that serves as a critical nexus between lipid metabolism and immune regulation. It exhibits dual and context-dependent functions by hydrolyzing platelet-activating factor (PAF) and oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL). The degradation of PAF results in the production of Lysoplatelet activating factor (LysoPAF), which attenuates inflammatory signaling. In contrast, the hydrolysis of oxLDL generates lysophosphatidylcholine (LysoPC) and oxidized fatty acids (oxFA), which exacerbate vascular inflammation, promote macrophage M1 polarization, and inhibit CD8(+) T cell activity. Through these pathways, Lp-PLA2 is implicated in a range of diseases, including atherosclerosis, diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, cancer, autoimmune disorders, and inflammation associated with infections. Despite extensive pharmacological interventions targeting this enzyme, clinical outcomes have been inconsistent, reflecting its complex roles across various pathophysiological contexts. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the mechanisms of Lp-PLA2, its associations with diseases, and its therapeutic implications, emphasizing its potential as both a biomarker and a therapeutic target at the intersection of lipid metabolism and immune response.",

Additionally, in silico tools, BioTransformer and DIGEP-Pred, were employed to elucidate metabolic pathways more effectively for detoxifying these xenobiotics and to evaluate their putative effects on gene transcription, respectively. Exposure to TF and TN, either alone or in combination, did not affect lymphocyte viability at the tested concentrations. However, both compounds induced an increase in the percentage of DNA strand breaks after treatment. The in silico predictions suggested that the interaction with the cytochrome P450 isoforms (CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6) differed for each compound analyzed. Gene expression prediction indicated that TF and TN may up-regulate genes involved with hormonal alterations, Alzheimer's disease risk, and cancer progression (SF1, SPON1, ADGRF5, and RORB). While they may down-regulate a gene involved with changes in heart rhythm and neurotoxicity (HCN1). In conclusion, our findings reinforced that the triazole fungicides TF and TN, while effective in agriculture, may pose risks to genomic stability in humans, highlighting the importance of biomonitoring studies in exposed populations.",

    "title": "The gene expression landscape of disease genes.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Fine-mapping and gene-prioritisation techniques applied to the latest genome-wide association study (GWAS) results have prioritised hundreds of genes as causally associated with disease. Here we leverage these recently compiled lists of high-confidence causal genes to interrogate where in the body disease genes operate, providing a more direct approach than previous studies, which have primarily relied on the enrichment of GWAS signals among genes with cell- or tissue-specific expression. RESULTS: By integrating GWAS summary statistics, gene prioritisation results, and RNA-seq data from 46 tissues and 204 cell types, we directly analyse the gene expression of putative disease genes across the body in relation to 11 major diseases and cancers. In tissues and cell types with established disease relevance, disease genes show higher and more specific gene expression compared to control genes. Moreover, we detect elevated expression in tissues and cell types without previous links to the corresponding disease. While some of these results may be explained by cell types that span multiple tissues, such as macrophages in brain, blood, lung and spleen in relation to Alzheimer's disease (P-values < 10(-3)), the cause for others is unclear and warrants further investigation. To support functional follow-up studies of disease genes, we identify technical and biological factors influencing their expression. Finally, we highlight tissue-disease pairs in which significantly elevated expression is associated with increased odds of inclusion in drug development programmes. CONCLUSIONS: We provide our systematic testing framework as an open-source, publicly available tool that can be utilised to offer novel insights into the genes, tissues and cell types involved in any disease, with the potential for informing drug development and delivery strategies.",

    "title": "Engineering chimeric antigen receptor CD4 T cells for Alzheimer's disease.",
    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the prevailing cause of age-associated dementia worldwide. Current standard of care relies on antibody-based immunotherapy. However, antibody-based approaches carry risks for patients, and their effects on cognition are marginal. Increasing evidence suggests that T cells contribute to AD onset and progression. Unlike the cytotoxic effects of CD8(+) cells, CD4(+) T cells capable of regulating inflammation show promise in reducing pathology and improving cognitive outcomes in mouse models of AD and in aging. Here, we sought to exploit the beneficial properties of CD4(+) T cells while circumventing the need for TCR and peptide-MHC antigen discovery, thereby providing a potential universal therapeutic approach. To achieve this, we engineered CD4(+) T cells with chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) targeting fibrillar forms of aggregated amyloid-beta. Our findings demonstrate that optimized CAR-T cells can alter amyloid deposition in the dura and reduce parenchymal pathology in the brain. Furthermore, we observed that CAR-T treatment promotes the expansion and recruitment of endogenous CD4(+) T cells into the brain parenchyma and leptomeninges. In summary, we established the feasibility of amyloid plaque-specific CAR-T cells as a potential therapeutic avenue for AD. These findings highlight the potential of CD4(+) CAR-T therapy not only to modify amyloid pathology but also to reshape the immune landscape of the CNS, paving the way for future development of cellular immunotherapies for neurodegenerative disease.",

    "abstract": "Aging somatic cells are characterized by specific chromosome aneuploidy, particularly involving chromosome Y (ChrY) and chromosome 21 (Chr21), which are associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. This study investigates the role of DNA replication within centromeric regions of these chromosomes using human neural progenitor cells engineered to overexpress either wild-type (wt) or pseudo-hyper-phosphorylated (php) Tau protein. We developed a method to analyze replication dynamics in centromeric DNA. Our findings reveal that replication origins and fork pausing events are mainly located within alpha-satellite sequences of ChrY and Chr21, where wt and php Tau distinctly modulate origin activation and initiation. Mass spectrometry analysis on immunoprecipitated Tau identified nuclear interactors of Tau, particularly in its php form, which might directly influence the chromatin architecture and gene expression. These studies provide critical insights into the molecular mechanisms of aneuploidy in tauopathies.",

    "title": "Pathophysiological significance of the TRPM2 ion channel as a potential target in cancer, neurological disorders, and ischemia/reperfusion injury.",
    "abstract": "The transient receptor potential melastatin 2 (TRPM2) ion channel is a redox-sensitive, non-specific cation channel that plays a vital role in the regulation of Ca(2+)(2 +) homeostasis and cellular functions in response to oxidative stress. However, aberrant expression of TRPM2 is associated with various pathological conditions. Overexpression of TRPM2 promotes cell survival in multiple malignancies, including neuroblastoma, lung, prostate, stomach, and pancreatic cancers. TRPM2 also mediates different neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and epilepsy, and contributes to ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. This review provides a comprehensive summary of the pathophysiological significance of TRPM2, covering the structural features, regulation, and oxidative stress signaling, with a major focus on the mechanistic pathways that link TRPM2 to these diseases. We discuss the therapeutic potential of TRPM2, its long non-coding antisense RNA (TRPM2-AS), and provide a comprehensive overview of currently available TRPM2 inhibitors, including adenosine diphosphate ribose (ADPR) analogs, small molecules, and peptides. This review covers an in-depth analysis of the structural activity relationships (SAR), pharmacokinetic (PK) properties of these TRPM2 inhibitors, detailing their preclinical efficacy studies, and outlining their shortcomings. Overall, we conclude that TRPM2 represents a promising drug target for effective therapies in several major disease indications.",

    "title": "Development of Hierarchical Tandem Heterojunction with Visible Light Enhanced Peroxidase-Like Activity for All-in-Capillary Self-Calibrating SERS Immunoassay of Abeta(1-42).",
    "abstract": "Aiming to meet the critical need for user-friendly and sensitive clinical analysis platforms, an all-in-capillary SERS analytical system integrated with a visible-light-enhanced nanozyme for highly sensitive and convenient biomarker detection was developed. The system employs a hierarchical tandem heterojunction (TiO(2)/MoS(2)/CoFe(2)O(4)) as a peroxidase-like nanozyme, which significantly enhances separation and transfer of photogenerated charges under visible light. This nanozyme catalyzes the oxidation of leucocrystal violet to crystal violet, generating a characteristic Raman signal at 923 cm(-1). To ensure analytical reliability, the inner wall of the capillary was modified with TiO(2) as an internal standard, enabling signal self-calibration. This integrated platform allows direct sampling of finger blood without any pretreatment, performing all-in-capillary SERS detection. The proposed method achieves ultrasensitive detection of Alzheimer's disease biomarker Abeta(1-42), with a wide linear range of 1.0 x 10(-3) to 1.0 x 10(-7) mug/mL, a low detection limit of 0.089 pg/mL, and satisfactory recovery of 94.3%-101% in human serum. The method was successfully applied to clinical serum samples from Alzheimer's patients and controls of different groups, revealing statistically significant differences in Abeta(1-42) levels. Furthermore, the results showed excellent agreement with those obtained by the reference ELISA method, demonstrating high accuracy and practical applicability of our assay for early diagnosis and population screening. By combining rational nanozyme design with a miniaturized and calibration-free sampling interface, this work provides a streamlined bioanalytical strategy with great potential for point-of-care testing in early disease diagnosis.",

    "title": "Sex specific effects of a high fat diet on metabolism, cognition, and pathology in the Tg-SwDI mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia in the US, with over 80% of affected individuals experiencing comorbid metabolic disease. Along with age and sex, metabolic syndrome and prediabetes are known risk factors for developing dementia and AD, highlighting the complex nature of the disease. How these risk factors affect cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is less well studied. As such, we examined the effect of diet-induced metabolic syndrome and sex on cognition, neuroinflammation, and pathology in the Tg-SwDI mouse model of AD and CAA. METHODS: Male and female Tg-SwDI and WT mice were fed a low fat (LFD; 10% fat) or high fat (HFD; 60% fat) diet from 3 to 10 months of age. Metabolic, cognitive, and neuropathology outcomes were assessed. RESULTS: All HFD-fed mice gained weight and exhibited impaired glucose tolerance. Metabolic disturbances were most severe in AD females receiving HFD. In both males and females, HFD-fed AD mice showed increased anxiety-like behavior, decreased locomotor activity, and impaired recognition memory in the open field and novel object recognition tests, respectively. HFD-fed AD females specifically exhibited spatial memory deficits in the Barnes maze. Hippocampal microgliosis, activated microglia, and astrogliosis were more severe in AD mice, HFD decreased hippocampal microgliosis and astrogliosis but increased cytokine and chemokine expression in AD females. HFD-fed AD females had greater beta-amyloid plaques and CAA in the thalamus compared to LFD-fed AD controls. All metrics of neuroinflammation significantly correlated with CAA pathology in the thalamus. CONCLUSION: AD females experienced greater metabolic, cognitive, and pathologic effects in response to a HFD compared to AD males and WT controls. These observations provide a better understanding of how metabolic disease may differentially affect the development of dementia in men and women.",

    "abstract": "Genetic studies have linked EPHX2 (encoding soluble epoxide hydrolase, sEH) and PTGS2 (encoding cyclooxygenase-2, COX-2) to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Elevated levels of sEH and COX-2 found in AD patients and animals suggest their involvement in neurodegeneration, glial activation, vascular dysfunction, and inflammation. This study evaluated the effects of a new dual sEH/COX-2 inhibitor, PTUPB, on cerebrovascular function and cognition in TgF344-AD rats. The rats received oral PTUPB (2 mg/kg/day) for 25 days. Body weight, plasma glucose, and HbA1c levels remained stable between PTUPB- and vehicle-treated AD rats. PTUPB significantly improved recognition memory in AD rats, as detected by the novel object recognition test. Pressure myography showed that PTUPB restored myogenic responses and increased the distensibility of the middle cerebral arteries (MCAs) in AD rats. Acute PTUPB (0.1 and 1 muM) enhanced myogenic contraction in response to elevated perfusion pressure in AD MCAs, with minimal effects in wild-type vessels. Transcriptomic analysis of cerebral vascular smooth muscle cells from AD rats revealed that PTUPB influences genes involved in contractility, extracellular matrix remodeling, inflammation, and oxidative stress. These results provide new evidence that dual inhibition of sEH and COX-2 improves cognition in AD and is associated with enhanced myogenic response via attenuation of vascular remodeling. Our findings highlight the potential of PTUPB as a therapeutic approach for cerebrovascular dysfunction in AD.",

    "title": "Screening Molecular Recognition Element-Based SWCNT Optical Sensors for the Inflammatory Cytokine TNF-alpha.",
    "abstract": "TNF-alpha (Tumor Necrosis Factor) is a proinflammatory cytokine that amplifies inflammatory response and promotes leukocyte recruitment. TNF-alpha is primarily produced by activated macrophages, among others, in response to infection, inflammation, or tissue damage. Given its central role in normal and abnormal immune responses, it is the target of several therapeutics, such as adalimumab and etanercept. TNF-alpha is also a prognostic and diagnostic biomarker associated with Rheumatoid Arthritis, Alzheimer's disease, Multiple Sclerosis, several kidney diseases, several cancers, Type 2 diabetes, sepsis, and others. Spatial quantification of TNF-alpha in disease models can also be a powerful tool to understand the contributions of inflammatory processes to disease progression. Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) are cylindrical carbon lattices that emit distinct near-infrared bandgap photoluminescence. In this work, we evaluated three aptamer-based sensor constructs, plus an additional two iterations of one aptamer sequence, and two antibody-based sensor constructs for TNF-alpha that use SWCNT near-infrared photoluminescence signal transduction. Several, but not all, of these aptamer and antibody-based sensors sensitively and selectively detected TNF-alpha in serum in a physiologically relevant range, and we found that their sensing was improved by both passivation and incorporating an exogenous quencher onto the aptamer sequence. Specifically, we found that modification of one aptamer sequence with a Black Hole Quencher induced selective detection in serum when passivated with poly-L-Lysine. This study highlights the importance, and challenges, of translating previously-validated molecular recognition elements to new detection conditions, in this case on the surface of SWCNT and in challenging serum conditions. It also validated a lead sensor construct that builds upon constructs that failed in serum. We anticipate that the sensors evaluated here will have utility in both the diagnosis and study of inflammation-driven chronic disease, while the sensor assessment framework will help drive the broader field of molecularly specific diagnostics.",

    "abstract": "Insomnia, a prevalent sleep disorder, poses significant threats to both physical and mental health. Traditional studies suggest multiple factors are associated with insomnia, yet the causal direction often remains unclear and susceptible to confounding biases. Mendelian randomization, a cutting-edge method leveraging genetic instrumental variables for causal inference, effectively overcomes these limitations by providing high-quality evidence to clarify causal relationships between insomnia and various diseases. This review systematically integrates 105 recent Mendelian randomization studies on insomnia. Evidence indicates that insomnia exerts clear causal effects on multiple diseases, though the strength of these associations and the robustness of evidence vary by disease type. Insomnia is a robust risk factor for coronary heart disease, anxiety-depressive disorders, type 2 diabetes, and chronic pain. Causal relationships with osteoarthritis and lung cancer are also supported, though effect sizes are relatively small. Conversely, associations with Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia remain unconfirmed. The studies establish a dominant causal direction from \"insomnia --> disease,\" effectively correcting potential reverse causality bias in observational research. These findings reposition insomnia from a common symptom to a key modifiable cause of a range of psychosomatic disorders. Causal inferences grounded in genetic evidence provide a robust scientific foundation for early identification of high-risk populations, precision prevention targeting insomnia, and cross-system comorbid management.",

    "title": "ISX9 activates the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway and exerts neuroprotective effects in Alzheimer's disease.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Defective Wnt/beta-catenin signaling is closely associated with the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), thus validating this pathway as a therapeutic target for AD. ISX9 is a potent agonist of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway. However, it remains unknown whether ISX9 exerts anti-AD effects by enhancing the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway. We therefore explored the neuroprotective potential of ISX9 using both hippocampal neuron-derived HT22 cells and 5xFAD transgenic mouse model of AD. METHODS: In HT22 cells, we employed the SuperTOPFlash reporter gene, Co-IP and Western blot assays to investigate the mechanism by which ISX9 activates the Wnt signaling pathway. The effects of ISX9 on the biological behavior of HT22 cells were further evaluated through MTT, BrdU and IF staining. To study the therapeutic effect of ISX9 on AD, six-month-old 5xFAD transgenic mice were randomly divided into four groups: WT, WT/ISX9, AD and AD/ISX9. The mice were intraperitoneally injected with ISX9 or vehicle at an interval of one day for 2 months. Behavioral tests were conducted to evaluate the cognitive and learning abilities of mice, while the expression levels of Abeta peptides, Tau-related proteins, neuroinflammatory factors, blood-brain barrier (BBB)-related proteins and the components of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling were investigated. RESULTS: Our results demonstrated that ISX9 potently activated Wnt/beta-catenin signaling by promoting the association of LRP6 with AXIN1, and increased the viability and proliferation of hippocampal cells. At the behavioral level, ISX9 improved learning and memory abilities in 5xFAD mice, and ameliorated hippocampal neuronal damage. Furthermore, ISX9 treatment effectively reduced the expression of Abeta peptides, total Tau, and phosphorylated Tau (S404) proteins in the AD mice. Mechanistically, ISX9 exhibited its neuroprotective effects, activating the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway via potentiating the interaction of LRP6 with AXIN1, upregulating the expression of BBB-related proteins and downregulating neuroinflammatory factors in AD mice. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that ISX9 potently activates the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway and confers cognitive protection in hippocampal cells and AD mice. This compound may serve as a promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of AD.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) and cancer are among the most prevalent age-related diseases. Despite previous research into their potential relationship, the nature of their association remains poorly understood. This study aims to examine the clinical characteristics of AD and various cancers using data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database, investigate the causal relationship between AD and cancers through Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis, and identify potential shared underlying mechanisms through transcriptomic profiling. METHODS: Clinical data from AD patients were retrieved from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database, and survival analysis was conducted using Kaplan-Meier curves. For the two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis, data were obtained from genome-wide association study (GWAS) databases. Multiple MR approaches, including inverse-variance weighted, MR-Egger, and weighted median methods, were applied, along with assessments of heterogeneity and sensitivity to ensure the robustness and reliability of the results. Transcriptomic data for AD, colorectal cancer (CRC), and breast cancer (BC) were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified through differential expression analysis, followed by functional enrichment analysis using Gene Ontology (GO) and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis. RESULTS: A total of 42,768 cancer patients who died from AD were included from the SEER database. Survival analysis revealed a more favorable prognosis (p < 0.01) in patients younger than 65 years. Asian or Pacific Islander patients exhibited better survival outcomes compared with White patients. Regarding tumor sites, patients with uterine corpus cancer had the best prognosis, while lung cancer patients had the poorest outcomes. Patients who received surgery, radiotherapy, or chemotherapy showed significantly improved survival compared to those who received no cancer treatment. Higher household income and being married were also associated with better prognosis, although no significant difference was observed by gender. MR analysis demonstrated a significant positive causal relationship between AD and CRC, and a weak inverse relationship between AD and BC, suggesting that increased genetic susceptibility to AD is associated with elevated CRC risk and reduced BC risk. Intersection analysis of DEGs revealed that shared DEGs between AD and BC were enriched in GO terms related to amino acid transport regulation, organic acid transport regulation, positive regulation of vesicle docking, and myo-inositol transmembrane import. Shared DEGs between AD and CRC were enriched in presynaptic actin cytoskeleton organization, proteasome ubiquitin-independent protein catabolic process, negative regulation of cellular amide metabolic process, and adenylate cyclase binding. KEGG enrichment analysis indicated that AD and BC may share the synaptic vesicle cycle pathway. CONCLUSION: Our study reveals significant subgroup heterogeneity among cancer patients who died from AD. MR analysis demonstrates that AD increases the risk of CRC while showing weak evidence for a decreased risk of BC. These associations may be mediated by mechanisms involving amino acid transport regulation, myo-inositol transmembrane import, and synaptic vesicle cycling. These findings offer new perspectives on the AD-cancer relationship and may guide future investigations into shared mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Sigma-1 receptor (S1R) is a \"pluripotent chaperone\" associated with pro-survival functions. Pieces of evidence show it as a promising therapeutic target for treating neurodegeneration. Encouraging results previously obtained with phenoxyalkylpiperidines prompted us to build a second generation of molecules using 1-[2-(4-chlorophenoxy)ethyl]-4-methylpiperidine (1), the most potent antiamnesic S1R ligand in vivo, as the lead-compound. Structural changes in the basic moiety and aromatic substitution were introduced, and features impacting on the S1R affinity and selectivity were clarified, also through docking studies and molecular dynamics (MD). The most promising phenoxyalkylpiperidines advanced to a phenotypic screening in wfs1ab(KO) zebrafish larvae to assess hyperlocomotion reduction. Seven hit compounds were selected for the BiP-S1R dissociation as a measure of their agonist activity, followed by the preclinical evaluation of their activity against Alzheimer's Disease (AD) in mice. These phenoxyethylpiperidines demonstrated to potently prevent AD-like amnesia without toxicity, appearing as promising agents for further preclinical studies against neurodegeneration.",

    "title": "Restoration of intracellular osmotic pressure balance induced by protein nanoparticles: A potential target for developing Alzheimer's disease treatment strategies.",
    "abstract": "The progressive accumulation of amyloid-beta and glutamate in synapses is a characteristic feature of early-stage Alzheimer's disease. This study investigated the influence of transmembrane osmotic pressure on Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis using a fluorescence resonance energy transfer-based optical probe for intermediate filament tension. Cotreatment with amyloid-beta and glutamate at predicted cerebrospinal fluid levels induced Alzheimer's disease-like neuronal injury. Probe-transfected cells were used to monitor intermediate filament tension, whereas cytoplasmic osmolality was measured using a freezing point osmometer under individual and combined treatment with amyloid-beta and glutamate. The results showed that the combined treatment of 50 nM amyloid-beta and 0.3 mM glutamate significantly elevated intermediate filament tension and osmotic pressure. Cellular experiments indicated that this increase resulted from the formation of intracellular protein nanoparticles through nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor protein 3 inflammasome formation and cytoskeletal depolymerization. Oligomers of 50 nm amyloid-beta induced an outward membrane current, whereas 0.3 mM glutamate increased both amyloid-beta-induced current and calcium signals. The increase in protein nanoparticle levels and Ca2+ signals promoted voltage-dependent nonselective cation and anion influx, resulting in upregulated osmotic pressure, which was closely associated with the sensitization of ion channels elicited by calmodulin and protein kinase C activation. The attenuation of intracellular protein nanoparticles and desensitization of ion channels by drug combinations effectively alleviated transmembrane osmotic pressure and Alzheimer's disease-like neuronal injury. Behavioral assays performed using Caenorhabditis elegans Alzheimer's disease models further confirmed the efficacy of drug combinations. Therefore, protein nanoparticle-induced osmotic pressure plays a pivotal role in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis, particularly in response to amyloid-beta and glutamate cotreatment. Restoring intracellular osmotic pressure seems to be a potential target for developing new effective therapeutic strategies for Alzheimer's disease.",

    "title": "Raspberry protective role in inflammatory diseases: An overview.",
    "abstract": "Inflammation is a natural immune response triggered by multiple factors such as pathogens, damaged cells, and toxic substances. These triggers can lead to both acute and chronic inflammatory reactions in different tissues, contributing to the development of several inflammatory disorders, including cardiovascular diseases, neuroinflammation, arthritis, and cancer. Both infectious and non-infectious stimuli activate immune cells and initiate critical inflammatory signaling pathways. Raspberries (Rubus idaeus) are abundant in bioactive constituents, especially polyphenols like anthocyanins, flavanols, phenolic acids, urolithin A, and ellagic acid, all of which possess notable anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant activities. These compounds have been shown to regulate various inflammatory signaling pathways, including MAPKs, NF-kappaB, PI3K/Akt, AP-1, IL-6, TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, CD40, nitric oxide (NO), caspases, and the JAK-STAT pathway. Studies have emphasized their broad pharmacological effects, such as anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, hepatoprotective, cardioprotective, gastroprotective, anti-obesity, skin depigmenting, and bone-regenerative properties. This review emphasizes mechanistic insights into raspberries' protective roles in managing inflammatory-related disorders, particularly cardiovascular diseases, neurodegenerative conditions, and cancer, and highlights their therapeutic potential.",

    "title": "Recommendations from the European interdisciplinary council on ageing on physical activity and diet for mental health conditions in older adults.",
    "abstract": "The global rise in life expectancy is accompanied by an increase in the prevalence of mental health conditions among older adults, including mild cognitive impairment (MCI), dementia, delirium, depression, anxiety, and other severe mental illness. These conditions significantly impact independence, increase healthcare costs, and increase mortality risk. Mounting evidence underscores the central role of modifiable lifestyle factors-particularly physical activity and diet-in the prevention and management of these conditions. This consensus, developed under the auspices of the European Interdisciplinary Council on Ageing (EICA), synthesizes current evidence and expert perspectives. Regular exercise, ranging from aerobic and resistance training to mind-body practices, improves cognition, mood, and physical resilience, while also mitigating cardiometabolic and functional risks. Similarly, adherence to dietary patterns such as the Mediterranean or MIND diets has been consistently associated with reduced incidence of cognitive decline, Alzheimer's disease, and comorbid chronic illnesses, although much of the evidence is observational. Landmark multidomain trials, including the Finnish FINGER and U.S. POINTER studies, have shown that combined interventions targeting diet, physical activity, cognitive stimulation, and social activity can slow cognitive decline in at-risk populations. Lifestyle strategies that promote brain health may enhance functional outcomes in dementia and, in turn, mitigate the risk of delirium. However, widespread implementation of such strategies faces numerous barriers, including physical frailty, socioeconomic constraints, health system fragmentation, and stigma. To overcome these barriers, caregivers, healthcare and public health professionals, policymakers, and community organizations must collaborate in designing accessible, culturally sensitive, and sustainable interventions at a policy level. Emerging digital tools, group-based programs, and co-designed approaches offer novel opportunities to enhance adherence and impact. Integrating lifestyle interventions into standard healthcare pathways represents an urgent, cost-effective strategy to promote mental health and resilience in ageing populations worldwide. This document provides actionable recommendations to guide policy, research, and clinical implementation across diverse health systems.",

    "title": "Co-occurrence of lung adenocarcinoma with rapidly progressive dementia and multiple cerebral microbleeds: a case report.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Various neurological diseases can cause rapidly progressive dementia, which is a clinical syndrome characterized by a rapid decline in cognitive function over a short period, typically less than 1 or 2 years. It can be caused by various neurological diseases, including neurodegenerative, inflammatory, vascular, metabolic, and neoplastic central nervous system diseases. Rapidly progressive dementia is particularly associated with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, but other conditions such as immune-mediated encephalitis, rapidly progressive subtypes of Alzheimer's disease, and various other mimics of prion diseases must also be considered. Multiple cerebral microbleeds are typical imaging features of cerebral small vessel diseases, but can also appear in other rare conditions. CASE PRESENTATION: We describe the case of a 45-year-old Asian female patient with lung adenocarcinoma who exhibited rapidly progressive dementia and multiple cerebral microbleeds. The patient was a 45-year-old woman who experienced rapid cognitive decline without obvious triggers, accompanied by disorganized speech, difficulty in expression, and short-term memory loss. Brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed widely distributed microhemorrhages, while computed tomography and pathological examination further confirmed the diagnosis of lung adenocarcinoma. The patient did not undergo a brain biopsy because of the rapid deterioration of her illness. Her condition deteriorated rapidly, leading to death in the fourth month. CONCLUSION: Herein, we discuss the presence of the apolipoprotein epsilon4 allele risk gene and the role of the tumor in causing multiple nodular lesions in the patient's brain, as well as multiple microbleeds. The role of the apolipoprotein epsilon4 allele risk gene in multiple nodular lesions of the brain and CMB requires further study, as it may be responsible for the rapid cognitive decline and imaging findings observed in patients. The role of the tumor in causing these brain lesions and cerebral microbleeds is also of interest as it may help to provide insight into the pathophysiological mechanisms of rapidly progressive dementia in the context of cancer. This case highlights the need for a comprehensive diagnosis, including magnetic resonance imaging, blood and cerebrospinal fluid analyses, and brain biopsy, to identify treatable causes of rapidly progressive dementia.",

    "abstract": "Biomolecular condensates have key roles in regulating cellular processes. Yet, the relationship between atomic features and condensate function remains poorly understood. We studied this relationship using the polar organizing protein Z (PopZ). Here, we revealed hierarchical assembly of PopZ into a filamentous condensate by integrating cryo-electron tomography, biochemistry, single-molecule techniques and molecular dynamics simulations. The PopZ helical domain drives filamentation and condensation, while the disordered region inhibits them. Phase-dependent conformational changes prevent interfilament contacts in the dilute phase and expose client-binding sites in the dense phase. Perturbing filament formation in vitro alters the dynamics of scaffold and client proteins and the condensate's wetting behavior. In cells, perturbing either filament formation or the ability of filaments to condense impairs PopZ function and leads to growth phenotypes. These findings establish a multiscale framework linking molecular interactions and condensate ultrastructure to cellular function.",

    "abstract": "The 13th International Symposium on Heat Shock Proteins in Biology, Medicine and the Environment, organized by the Cell Stress Society International (CSSI), was held in October 2025 in Syracuse, NY, and brought together investigators spanning basic, translational, and clinical stress biology. The meeting highlighted the continued evolution of the heat shock response from a canonical transcriptional program to a complex, multi-layered network integrating transcriptional condensates, posttranslational regulation of chaperones, spatial organization, and system-level stress adaptation. Scientific sessions showcased advances in stress-induced transcription and genome control, the expanding Hsp90/Hsp70 \"chaperone code,\" proteostasis and protein quality control, mitochondrial chaperones and metabolic regulation, cancer-immune interfaces, host-pathogen interactions, and the roles of chaperones in aging and neurodegenerative disease. Particular emphasis was placed on emerging therapeutic and diagnostic strategies, including isoform-specific chaperone inhibitors, co-chaperone targeting, theranostic approaches, and clinical-stage candidates. Systems-level analyses of stress resilience, extracellular chaperone signaling, and organismal adaptation further underscored the breadth of stress biology across scales. The symposium also honored the legacy of Dr Len Neckers, whose pioneering contributions to Hsp90 biology shaped the field, and recognized outstanding scientific achievements through CSSI awards and fellowships. Collectively, the work presented reflects a field that continues to deepen mechanistic understanding while advancing toward precision-based therapeutic and diagnostic applications. This meeting report summarizes these developments and highlights future directions for stress biology research.",

    "abstract": "Amyloid beta (Abeta) accumulation is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Emerging evidence suggests that impaired microglial Abeta phagocytosis is a key feature in AD, highlighting the therapeutic potential of enhancing this innate immune function. Here, we demonstrate that genetic deletion or pharmacological inhibition of protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) ameliorated memory deficits and reduced Abeta burden in APP/PS1 mice. Moreover, we show that PTP1B was highly expressed in microglia, and its deficiency promoted a transcriptional shift toward immune activation and phagocytosis. Consistently, PTP1B deletion in microglia enhanced phagocytosis and energy metabolism, supported by increased AKT-mTOR signaling, a pathway essential for meeting the energy demands of activation. Mechanistically, we identified spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK), a key regulator of microglial phagocytosis, as a direct substrate of PTP1B. Inhibition of SYK showed that PTP1B modulates microglial activation in a SYK-dependent manner. These findings established PTP1B as a critical modulator of microglial activation and a potential therapeutic target for AD.",

    "title": "Nutritional and Health Potential of Edible Seeds: Micronutrient Bioavailability and Mechanistic Insights.",
    "abstract": "Edible seeds have gained substantial scientific attention for their exceptional nutrient density and potential health-promoting properties. They are rich in dietary fiber, high-quality proteins, mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids, omega-3 fatty acids, vitamins (E, C, and K), and minerals such as magnesium, zinc, potassium, and iron. Bioactive compounds like polyphenols, carotenoids, and peptides contribute to their strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, helping to mitigate oxidative stress and inflammation linked to chronic diseases. This review focuses on pumpkin, flax, sesame, chia, and melon seeds, valuable sources of essential micronutrients and bioactives with demonstrated nutraceutical potential. Pumpkin seeds enhance immune strength because of their mineral profile, whereas chia seeds provide omega-3 fatty acids associated with neuroprotection and anti-Alzheimer's effects. The omega-3 content of flax and chia seeds offers cardioprotective benefits, whereas sesame lignans (sesamin) exhibit lipid-lowering and anti-aging properties. Flaxseed's secoisolariciresinol diglycoside (SDG) contributes to cardiovascular and anti-cancer effects, and melon seed squalene supports immune health and exerts anti-cancer activity. Mechanistic studies highlight these seeds' ability to regulate molecular pathways related to oxidative stress, inflammation, hypertension, diabetes, cancer, and metabolic disorders. Their bioactive constituents act through antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and metabolic-regulating mechanisms, validating their classification as functional foods. Evidence from clinical and biochemical studies largely supports these benefits, although some claims stem from preliminary or in vitro findings. Overall, pumpkin, flax, sesame, chia, and melon seeds demonstrate significant potential as natural sources of nutrients and bioactive compounds that promote cardiovascular, metabolic, and immune health. Their integration into daily diets and functional food formulations could play a vital role in preventing lifestyle-related chronic diseases and enhancing overall well-being.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Existing evidence on the association between smoking and hypertension (HTN) remains conflicting, and the potential role of systemic inflammation in mediating smoking-related mortality among hypertensive patients is poorly understood. This study aimed to investigate the association between smoking status, smoking volume, and HTN risk in a large, nationally representative sample. Furthermore, we sought to determine whether systemic inflammation, measured by the systemic inflammation index (SII), mediates the association between smoking and all-cause mortality in hypertensive individuals. METHODS: This cross-sectional, pooled secondary data analysis study utilized data from 10 cycles of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from 1999 to 2018. Data on smoking, covariates, and hypertension status were collected through standardized interviews, questionnaires, and laboratory/physical examinations. A total of 28967 participants were included after excluding those with incomplete data. Propensity score matching (PSM) analysis was employed to adjust for confounding factors such as age, gender, BMI, race, and other sociodemographic variables. Logistic regression and restricted cubic spline regression were used to assess the dose-response relationship between smoking and HTN. Mediation analysis was performed to evaluate the role of systemic inflammation, as measured by the systemic inflammation index (SII), in the increased mortality risk among hypertensive smokers. RESULTS: Smoking significantly increased the likelihood of HTN after adjusting for confounders (adjusted odds ration, AOR=1.18; 95% CI: 1.10-1.27). A dose-response relationship was observed, with individuals smoking >30 cigarettes/day having the highest likelihood of HTN (AOR=1.37; 95% CI: 1.07-1.75). PSM analysis confirmed these findings, showing a significant increase in HTN prevalence among smokers (p=0.045). Smoking was also associated with increased overall mortality in hypertensive patients (HR=1.993; 95% CI: 1.766-2.249). Mediation analysis revealed that systemic inflammation, as measured by SII, accounted for 87.70% of the increased mortality in hypertensive smokers (ACME=0.068, p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: This study establishes a significant association between smoking, HTN and mortality. The findings underscore a potential dose-response trend between cigarette consumption and HTN, with systemic inflammation playing a key role in mediating the higher mortality observed in hypertensive smokers. Interventions targeting smoking cessation and systemic inflammation may significantly reduce the burden of HTN-related morbidity and mortality.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIM: Fasting insulin variability has emerged as a potential marker of metabolic dysregulation, but its long-term implications for cognitive function remain unclear. This study aimed to clarify the role of long-term fasting insulin variability in predicting individual cognitive function risk. METHODS: We analyzed data from CARDIA study participants who underwent cognitive testing and had at least three insulin measurements. Fasting insulin was measured at 7 timepoints over 30 years. Intra-individual insulin variability was assessed using standard deviation (SD), coefficient of variation (CV), and average real variability (ARV). Cognitive function was evaluated using the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST), Stroop Test, and Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT), with results standardized to z-scores and combined into a global cognitive z-score. Multivariable linear models were used to assess associations with cognitive performance. RESULTS: In the 25-year analysis (n = 2712), higher long-term insulin variability was significantly associated with poorer global cognitive performance at year 25 after adjustment for demographic, lifestyle, and cardiometabolic covariates (CV-insulin: beta=-0.719; 95% CI: -1.161 to -0.276; P < 0.01; SD-insulin: beta=-0.019; 95% CI: -0.036 to -0.002; P < 0.05). These associations remained significant after additional adjustment for either concurrent insulin at year 25 or mean insulin levels over 25 years. Domain-specific analyses showed that higher insulin variability was associated with lower DSST z-scores (worse attention) and higher Stroop interference z-scores (worse executive function). Extended analyses over 30 years (n = 2069) yielded consistent results: higher CV-insulin was inversely associated with global cognitive z-scores (beta=-0.837; 95% CI: -1.347 to -0.327), as well as with DSST (beta=-0.347; 95% CI: -0.581 to -0.112) and RAVLT z-scores (beta=-0.276; 95% CI: -0.522 to -0.031). These associations persisted after full adjustment for year 30 covariates and time-varying confounders across the follow-up, supporting the temporal robustness and clinical relevance of insulin variability as an independent predictor of cognitive function. CONCLUSIONS: Greater long-term insulin variability is independently associated with poorer midlife cognitive performance. These findings highlight insulin variability as a potential marker of cognitive health risk.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Accurate assessment of mortality, bleeding, and atherothrombotic risk in patients with cancer and acute coronary syndrome could inform novel personalised treatment strategies, but no standardised tools for this purpose exist. We aimed to develop and validate a clinically applicable risk score for mortality, bleeding, and ischaemic events in patients with cancer and acute coronary syndrome. METHODS: In this model development and validation study, we obtained data for 1 017 759 patients who presented with acute coronary syndrome in England, UK (n=815 170; 36 771 with cancer), Sweden (n=194 059; 10 262 with cancer), and Switzerland (n=8530; 203 with cancer) between Jan 1, 2004, and Aug 8, 2023. Machine learning models were developed to predict all-cause mortality, major bleeding events, and ischaemic events, defined as a composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, and ischaemic stroke, in patients with cancer and acute coronary syndrome from England in a competing risks framework with a prediction horizon of 6 months. Final models (the ONCO-ACS score) were externally validated in geographically distinct held out datasets from the English Midlands, Sweden, and Switzerland. FINDINGS: Patients with cancer and with acute coronary syndrome were characterised by high rates of mortality (cumulative incidence 27.8% [95% CI 27.3-28.3]), major bleeding (7.3% [7.0-7.5]), and ischaemic events (16.1% [15.7-16.4]) and had a distinct risk profile. The ONCO-ACS score was informed by a single set of variables: tumour type, time since cancer diagnosis, metastatic disease, age, haemoglobin, heart rate, estimated glomerular filtration rate, BMI, Killip class, cardiac arrest, and major bleed within 6 months. Accounting for traditional and cancer-related risk factors, ONCO-ACS showed a time-dependent area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (tAUC) at 6 months of 0.84 (0.83-0.85) for all-cause mortality, 0.70 (0.68-0.73) for major bleeding, and 0.79 (0.78-0.81) for ischaemic events on internal validation. On external validation, ONCO-ACS achieved similar performance for all-cause mortality (tAUC at 6 months 0.84 [0.82-0.85] for the English Midlands, 0.80 [0.79-0.82] for Sweden, and 0.83 [0.76-0.91] for Switzerland), major bleeding events (0.70 [0.67-0.74] for the English Midlands, 0.67 [0.65-0.70] for Sweden, and 0.74 [0.57-0.91] for Switzerland), and ischaemic events (0.76 [0.74-0.78] for the English Midlands, 0.70 [0.69-0.72] for Sweden, and 0.73 [0.61-0.86] for Switzerland). ONCO-ACS was well calibrated and decision curve analyses suggested favourable clinical utility. Applying ONCO-ACS to current guidelines suggests that most patients with cancer and acute coronary syndrome qualify for invasive management and long dual antiplatelet therapy using clopidogrel. INTERPRETATION: The ONCO-ACS score provides a validated practical tool for predicting mortality, bleeding, and ischaemic risk in patients with cancer and acute coronary syndrome. Combined assessment of competing outcome risks could facilitate balancing treatment benefits and harms.

    "abstract": "Cellular plasticity is crucially important in cancer-induced cell reprogramming, as well as in regeneration therapies in diabetes, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's diseases. Protein-protein interaction, signaling, and gene regulatory networks are increasingly used to describe plasticity-induced cellular adaptation in disease progression. This review delineates how network analysis of cell plasticity leads to novel therapy options against 1) cancer progression; 2) epithelial-mesenchymal transition-induced metastases; 3) cancer stem cells, and 4) pre-existent drug-resistant cells. Network plasticity-designed sequential and differentiation therapies are also outlined. 55 plasticity-related cancer drug targets are listed, where 20 have already approved drugs, 9 have investigational drugs, and 26 are drug target candidates. The recent expansion of plastic network-driven pancreatic beta cell and neuron regeneration therapies is described in diabetes, as well as in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, respectively. Finally, six major network-related research gaps and promising future research areas are outlined, including the discovery of plasticity-related cancer signaling pathways and cross-talks, cancer resensitization therapies, and the use of recently available proteome-wide network data and models to find novel cancer cell differentiation cocktails, drug targets, proper timing, and biomarkers of sequential therapies, as well as to perform in silico drug combination screens and in silico clinical trials.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Periodontitis has increasingly been recognized for its impact on systemic health. Mendelian Randomization (MR), an emerging causal inference method, effectively overcomes confounding biases in observational studies. To systematically evaluate the causal relationship between periodontitis and various systemic diseases through a meta-analysis of mendelian randomization studies. METHODS: The China National Knowledge Infrastructure, WanFang data, PubMed, Web of Science and Science Direct were searched for mendelian randomization studies on periodontitis in relation to systemic disorders. Meta-analysis was performed on data gathered using the inverse-variance weighted and mendelian randomization-Egger methods. RESULTS: A total of 610 records was screened. The systematic review included 78 mendelian randomization experiments, while the meta-analysis included 34. There was strong evidence linking periodontitis to an increased risk of cardioembolic stroke and depression. However, the data showed that periodontitis had no substantial causal association with Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, coronary atherosclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, gastric cancer, psoriasis, Sjogren's syndrome, or inflammatory bowel disease. CONCLUSIONS: The evidence from mendelian randomization studies suggests that periodontitis plays a causal role in in cardioembolic stroke and depression. However, the rest of the findings differ from those of earlier observational research. As a result, future research should focus on resolving these constraints using bigger, more diverse populations and investigating the molecular mechanisms behind the observed relationships.

    "title": "XRepDDA: An Interpretable Drug-Disease Association Prediction Framework Leveraging Pretrained Chemical Language Models.",
    "abstract": "Drug repositioning aims to identify new indications for existing drugs, offering a cost-effective and time-efficient strategy for therapeutic development. Its core challenge lies in accurately predicting potential drug-disease associations (DDAs). However, existing computational approaches often suffer from inadequate drug representation, insufficient modeling of disease semantics, and imbalanced data distributions, which collectively limit predictive accuracy and generalization ability. To address these challenges, we propose an innovative framework, termed XRepDDA, that integrates multimodal feature representation with deep metric learning to improve DDA prediction accuracy and robustness. For drug representation, the SMI-TED pretrained chemical language model encodes SMILES sequences into chemically informative molecular embeddings. For disease representation, a hierarchical semantic graph based on the MeSH ontology is constructed together with a semantic-enhanced graph embedding strategy to capture hierarchical and semantic relationships among diseases. To mitigate class imbalance, we applied the AllKNN adaptive undersampling strategy. The prediction module is built upon an improved ModernNCA architecture, which learns a discriminative embedding space through deep metric learning. Experiments on multiple public benchmark data sets demonstrate that XRepDDA consistently outperforms diverse baseline models, including traditional machine learning, tree-based ensemble, and deep learning methods, achieving AUC and AUPR values of up to 0.9990 and 0.9991, respectively. Furthermore, molecular docking experiments on top-ranked candidate drugs for Alzheimer's disease and stomach neoplasms provide in silico validation of predictive reliability. To enhance interpretability, a multilevel explainability framework is established, combining SHAP-based global feature attribution with attention mechanisms and molecular perturbation analyses to identify key features and pharmacophores at the local level. These results support the chemical interpretability and the biological plausibility of the predictions.",
